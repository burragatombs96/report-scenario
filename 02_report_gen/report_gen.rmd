# Frame of Reference

REF-E scenarios over the time horizon 2024-2050 (with projections up to
2060) are elaborated by MBS Consulting experts on the base of
proprietary suites and market knowledge. Econometric and structural
models, as well as our expert sensitiveness, detailed knowledge of
regulation, and accurate monitoring of market outcomes underlie our
elaborations.

Gas and electricity forecasts consider the diverse geopolitical and
economic hypothesis deriving from the regulatory, financial and
fundamentals adjustments to the disruption generated both from the
pandemic and the Ukrainian war, which are seen as key determinants of
the future equilibrium of the energy markets.

Current scenario update incorporates an evolution of climate variables
in line with the historical average trend.

In this perspective, we defined three scenarios:

-   The **High Case scenario** is characterized by permanently high
    fuels and power prices amid negative or zero economic growth
    depressing investments and weighing on the energy transition
    process.\

-   In the **Reference scenario**, is characterized by the energy
    transition process progress leading to a diversification of energy
    sources supported by the existing policies. This, combined with
    efficiency maintains the energy market on a transformation path. The
    economic growth slowly recovers over the next two years.

-   The **Low Case scenario** would materialize in the event of
    favorable weather conditions and a fast energy transition, supported
    by low inflation and a faster economic recovery, reducing power and
    fossil fuels demand over the next few years. This would limit energy
    prices upside potential and then fuel a downward acceleration.

## Without reforms, how far could the Italian market advance in decarbonization?

### Key Insights {.unnumbered}

The 2021-2023 period put a lot of pressure on the energy markets in
Italy and Europe, underpinning the urgency to ensure diversification and
efficiency of energy supplies. More than ever, decarbonization of the
electricity sector by increasing the share of renewable and other
low-carbon sources in the energy mix is at the heart of the energy
policies applied across Europe and requires substantial overhaul of the
energy systems. The transformation is already taking place guided by
favorable market conditions driving new investments. Renewables and
energy storage solutions are gaining traction in most of the European
markets, including Italy.

Italy aims to embrace ambitious decarbonization goals for 2030,
indicating a nearly twofold increase in the current share of renewables
in electricity demand. The surge is foreseen due to expected rapid
electrification trends and will necessitate concurrent technological and
infrastructural development. One question remains: is the Italian market
prepared to fully embrace the transition? Can it facilitate the growth
and integration of renewable source at reduced costs for consumers and
investors? Which is the role of the regulatory framework and how far the
system could advance without reforms?

MBS delves into these critical topics in its latest market scenario
report for Italy. Starting from eased short-term gas market dynamics and
favourable renewable electricity production that contributed to keeping
power prices across Europe on a downward trend since the beginning of
2024, the report explores the range of risks and opportunities expected
in the long run on pure merchant basis. The analysis addresses the
discrepancies between the expected market trends and national
decarbonization objectives, outlining the gaps that must be bridged
moving forward.

Short-term GDP growth continues to be modest, supported by a gradual
rebound in industrial production driven by wage trends and anticipated
monetary policy adjustments. In the Reference scenario GDP growth is
expected to near 0.4% year-on-year in 2024, followed by a more robust
increase of 1% in 2025, driven by an anticipated easing of financial
conditions. A relatively weak industrial sector and restrained
investment weigh on 2024 performance. However, a gradual easing of
monetary policies in the second half of the year, coupled with positive
wage dynamics, should bolster growth in 2025. In High case scenario in
which the inflationary pressures persist, GDP could decline by 0.1%
year-on-year in 2024, recovering slightly in 2025 (+0.3%). The Low case
scenario is characterized by accelerated disinflation and rebound in
investments, GDP growth could reach 1.2% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025. In
the longer-term growth will rely mainly on factors such as the path of
disinflation, improved financing conditions, and the successful
implementation of the NRRP. In both Reference and Low scenarios,
economic growth is assumed to be supported by the successful execution
of NRRP initiatives, global economic recovery, and expedited green
transition reforms. In the High scenario, pressure from fiscal policies
and shortcomings in NRRP implementation would likely keep economic
growth stagnant, jeopardizing the progress of green transition.

Given the current competition in LNG supplies, as well as the level of
European domestic gas reserves and demand, notable surge in gas prices
is considered improbable until the upcoming winter season (excluding
worsening of the geopolitical context). Nevertheless, the prolonged
period of low prices is causing delays in the construction of
liquefaction capacity, potentially leading to renewed tensions between
supply and demand. Despite this, the possibility of a new bullish cycle
cannot be overlooked, particularly starting from the winter of
2025-2026. From 2026 on, LNG demand growth is expected to slow down,
settling below 5% annually as a result of rise in renewable energy
production and energy efficiency measures. A new wave of liquefaction
capacity is expected to commence operation by 2026, mostly led by the
United States and Qatar. The capacity expansion is expected to
significantly mitigate the risk of market scarcity.

Geopolitical tensions have not yet impacted the gas market in this
scenario, hence they are not factored into current pricing. However, any
further escalation in geopolitical tensions remains a significant risk
factor that could disrupt the short-term equilibrium. Low gas demand
throughout Europe in 2023 left storages well above historical averages,
causing gas prices to decline. Without resurgence in electricity demand
resulting in higher thermoelectric gas demand, the 2024 storage
injection demand is unlikely to affect gas prices in the coming months.
The Italian gas price remains closely linked to the European hub,
particularly the TTF. However, the temporary shutdown of the OLT
facility has disrupted Italian imports thus leading near-term forecasts
to suggest broader deviations from the TTF.

In our Reference scenario, the yearly averages for both PSV and TTF in
2024 stay below 40 €/MWh, reflecting the effects of limited gas demand
recovery, shift towards savings and efficiency reduces pressure on
distribution networks. Additionally, subdued growth in the
energy-intensive sector limits industrial demand, resulting in
lower-than-average thermoelectric gas demand. Delays in commissioning of
Ravenna FSRU have dampened expectations for gas demand recovery. if
tensions reemerge on LNG and TTF prices during winter of 2025-2026, PSV
is projected to reach 33 €/MWh. In Low scenario gas prices remain close
to 25 €/MWh in 2024, assuming faster energy transition and reduction of
global gas demand, the price will settle at near 15 €/MWh by 2026. Under
the High case scenario, gas prices are forecasted to average 50 €/MWh
due to the compounding effects of economic stagnation, decreased
investments, and an unstable geopolitical environment. The PSV is
expected to align with the mid-term normalization of European gas prices
towards 30 €/MWh by 2030, reflecting a gradual rebalancing of global gas
demand-supply dynamics amid the anticipated acceleration of the energy
transition. In the very long-term PSV price should converge to an
equilibrium of 25 €/MWh in the Reference scenario and 10 €/MWh in the
Low case, while it should settle above 40 €/MWh in the High scenario.
The enhancement into law of the ETS system reform confirms its pivotal
role in sustaining the decarbonization process. Introduction of new
measures occurs amidst weakened macroeconomic fundamentals, extended
period of low demand and bearish trends of CO2 prices since Q2-23. A
range of factors are estimated to have contributed to the decrease in
demand such as diminished levels of industrial production (notably in
energy-intensive sectors), increased energy costs from the previous year
prompting greater savings, higher inflation rates, and a restrictive
monetary policy that impacted economic growth adversely. In our
Reference scenario, the 2024 average CO2 price is projected to approach
65 €/ton, driven by the gradual implementation of the ETS system reform.
The phasing out of free allowances for the aviation sector, accounting
for 50% of the total by 2025, and the scheduled removal of 90 million
permits from the market in 2024, are expected to push allowances prices
upward as supply reduces. Additionally, the gradual inclusion of the
maritime transport sector starting from 2025, will further increase
overall demand and prices are expected to reach 107 €/ton in 2030. Main
concerns regard demand recovery, expected to be limited in the next
couple of years due to slow economic growth. The Low case scenario
incorporate a swift economic recover coupled with challenges in
decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors like aviation and maritime
transport. These factors lead to a substantial increase in demand
volume, pushing the CO2 price to surpass 130 €/ton before 2030. If
further demand disruptions arise due to elevated energy costs, reduced
industrial output, and delays in implementing new regulations, the High
case scenario might materialize: ETS price that fails to rebound,
staying under 50 €/ton in the short term and under 75 €/ton until 2030.
The effectiveness of the ETS System plays a crucial role in reaching the
long-term emission reduction targets, with the CO2 price projected to
surpass 120 €/ton in the Reference scenario by 2040 and potentially rise
to just under 150 €/ton in the Low scenario or near 90 €/ton in High
scenario.

In 2023, electricity consumption dropped to 306 TWh, reflecting a 3%
decline from 2022 . A slight recovery of 2024 macroeconomic outlook,
combined with improved end-use consumption electrification, is expected
to increase consumption to 312 TWh in the Reference scenario. A more
optimistic economic view could bring to 314 TWh as in the Low case
scenario, while a more pessimistic view and delay in final use
electrification is foreseen in the High scenario, 310 TWh. In the coming
years supportive economic measure driven NRRP and unfold of
electrification potential could determine a possible fork between 327
TWh in scenario High and 358 TWh in Low case, containment in efficiency
and moderate economic growth are expected in Reference case with an
electricity demand of 339 TWh in 2030. In the very long-term a
successful electrification trajectory and stable economic outlook could
see consumption reach 377 TWh in 2040 in Low scenario, a partial upside
of this trend is foreseen in Reference scenario with 364 TWh, while the
structural delay in High scenario result in an electricity demand of 340
TWh.

General contraction of electricity demand in European countries,
recovery in hydro generation after the severe drought of 2022 and the
first half of 2023 and enhanced availability of France nuclear plants
favored an increase in net import flow in 2023, +15 % y/y reaching 53
TWh. In the coming years still contained electricity demand, increase in
electricity import capacity at the Northern border support by the
commissioning of the new 1,200 MW HVDC connecting the Piossasco (Italy)
and Grand-Ile (France) electrical substations, operational since August
2023, will further contribute to supporting power flows from France to
Italy. Furthermore, high electricity imports to Italy are also favoured
by the PUN seen as stabilizing well above other European electricity
prices (particularly the French and the Swiss ones). In fact, the
average spread between the Italian power price and those of northern
borders nearly doubled over the last five years. Moving toward 2030
partial achievements of decarbonization targets in European countries,
gradual phase-out of coal-fired generation in continental Europe and
reduction in availability of France nuclear fleet are going to reshape
import flows toward Italy, defining a declining trend expected to reach
32 TWh in 2030 and 13 TWh in 2040, if investments are not made in new
nuclear generation capacity.

During 2023, a notable increase in renewable installation rate (+5.7 GW
compared to 1.5 GW/y during the last 5 years), driven by solar
technologies, marks a further step towards the net zero path in the long
run. 2023 momentum is expected to enhance over the coming years with a
yearly increase up to 6 GW (4.5 GW of solar and 1.5 GW of wind) in the
Low scenario and 3 GW (2 GW of solar and 1 GW of wind) in the Reference
case, still below the NIECP average annual target of 8 GW necessary to
reach the 2030 targets. Improved regulation, gradual reduction in
investment costs and ETS price signals should support the market parity
conditions in the long run. A draft decree, the so called FER X,
proposes contracts for differences that target the 2030 objectives,
limiting the space for market initiatives, with a quota of almost 70 GW
(45 GW solar and 16 GW wind) to be allocated between 2024 and 2028. The
decree now under review by the European Commission, aligns with the
objectives for 2030 of NIECP, future update are going to integrate this
evaluation when defined.

Renewable generation has seen a recovery during 2023 mainly driven by
hydro production +36% y/y, while wind and solar production increase by
15% and 10% respectively. Despite recover in hydro generation the
evolution of climate dynamic are expecting to affect production,
aligning yearly results with recent years average, around 45 TWh. In the
coming years the expectation of a slow recovery in electricity demand,
below 2019 level until 2026, and a sustained pace of renewable
installations are going to increase RES quota in the generation mix,
reaching in 2030 almost 50% in Reference scenario and 60% in Low case
respectively, while it should remain close to 40% in the High case. In
our scenario zonal distribution of the new capacity follow the patterns
revealed by Terna's connection request database, and new utility scale
projects are expected to be concentrated mostly in the Southern
macrozone and the two islands. Growth of small-scale distributed
renewables for self-consumption should be concentrated in the Norther
area following the historical path with 6% annual increase.

Grid expansion reflect Terna's 2023 Development Plan indications. In the
Reference case reinforcements are assumed operational already in the
2020s but the main improvements to resolve zonal congestions are
expected to be completed in the 2030s -- Tyrrhenian link and Adriatic
link as well as first portions of the Hypergrid. Faster penetration of
renewable energy in the Low case would require the realization of the
main projects even before 2030, while the slower system transition in
the High case postpone the key investments to the middle of the 2030s.

By 2030, significant overgeneration and curtailment risks are expected
to arise in the Southern zone and the Islands, which will prompt a surge
in new electrochemical storage projects. Depending on the alternative
scenarios of RES and grid development trajectories, these dynamics may
be accelerated or delayed, with expected 16 GW of storage capacity in
Reference scenario and 23 GW in Low case. Long-term development of
batteries should follow the opportunities for time-shifting applications
on the day-ahead market, with investments in power intensive
electrochemical batteries can be in-the-money in the medium-term, with
revenue streams deriving mainly from the participation in the balancing
phase of the Ancillary Services Market and a long-term capacity
remuneration through specific projects. Investments in merchant energy
intensive storage batteries are likely to be attractive only in the
long-term when time-shifting applications on the DAM could become
economically sustainable thanks to increasing price spread volatility
and the presence of overgeneration. In 2040, up to 28 GW of energy
intensive batteries are expected to be developed in our Reference
scenario and 30 GW in Low case. Regulatory framework is evolving
creating new opportunities for batterie, with MACSE a regulated
remuneration mechanism designed only for storage systems, Terna pays a
fixed remuneration (€/MWh/year) for the operator to provide capacity and
5% of revenues from balancing activities to support storage development,
auctions are scheduled for the end of 2024.

The need to boost energy independence in the decarbonization process at
European level has placed green hydrogen at the forefront of the
European energy strategy (REPowerEU). It is expected to determine the
allocation of substantial funding -- way more than the amount currently
earmarked -- to accelerate the development of a European hydrogen supply
chain, improving current cost perspectives of green solutions. But
accelerating renewables development poses the risk of structural
overgeneration if the development of BESS does not advance concurrently,
especially in less interconnected regions and have a high intensity of
renewables relative to demand, such as Sardinia and Sicily where
economically viable opportunities for competitive green hydrogen
consolidate starting from 2035.

During 2023 electricity prices drastically reduce after 2022 peak, -58%
averaging 127 €/MWh, the decreasing trend follow gas dynamics,
emphasizing electricity price dependency. The relaxation of short-term
gas market and increase in renewable electricity production have
contributed to maintaining downward pressure on power prices across
Europe since the beginning of the year. This trend will continue into
2024 due to improved conditions in the Italian gas market and further
expansion of renewable generation, with the 2024 average PUN is expected
to approach €100/MWh in Reference scenario and 96 €/MWh in Low case.
However, the recovery of CO2 prices in 2025, bolstered by the EU ETS
reform potentially coupled with renewed tensions in global gas market
supply-demand dynamics depending on delays in LNG liquefaction capacity
development, could result in higher electricity prices in 2025 and 2026,
with the PUN projected to average close to €110/MWh, in Low scenario
reduction in demand and faster transition push prices to 90 €/MWh.
Moving toward 2030 integration of renewables technologies in the energy,
further reduction in commodities levels and gradual grid improvements
push prices at 74 €/MWh Low case, in Reference case a partial delay in
decarbonization trajectory and higher PSV determine an average price of
106 €/MWh. In the mid-term renewables penetration, led by solar energy,
is expected to strongly affect peak/off-peak dynamics after 2030, when
the inversion of price spreads between time slots is expected to occur.
With the expected slow electricity demand recovery, the differences in
zonal prices will be limited due to reduced transit between market
zones. Additionally, abundant electricity imports from the northern
borders will further alleviate congestion. Average zonal spread are
expected to remain below €1/MWh in the short term, with southern market
zones experiencing a higher differential with the PUN. However, after
2026, zonal spreads are anticipated to widen as a result of increasing
electricity consumption, combined with accelerated development of
renewable energy and a gradual decrease in electricity imports. Over the
long term, the significant development of renewable energy sources in
the southern macro-zone is expected to drive prices down through the
cannibalization of solar technologies. Despite grid improvements,
bottlenecks are still expected between the northern and southern zones,
resulting in differing price levels in the 2030s. From 2035 onwards,
further grid reinforcements are assumed to occur, resulting in a
reduction of inter-zonal congestion issues on the mainland. However,
criticalities are likely to remain evident in the islands.

The Law 11/2024, known as DL Energia, mandates that starting from
January 1st, 2025, final customers will transition to paying zonal
prices based on wholesale market price trends, departing from PUN. The
reform is driven by the necessity to implement Capacity Allocation &
Congestion Management (CACM) rules, which aim to establish a unified
European market by simplifying algorithms, and to create locational
signals for both demand and supply. Many aspects still require
clarification, particularly the methodologies for implementation, which
will play a crucial role in defining the market impact of the reform.

In recent past, prices for renewable technologies have mirrored the
fluctuations in commodities markets, benefiting from bullish trends.
However, in 2023, prices began to gradually decrease, realigning the
zonal differently affected by energy mixes, in particularly the
reduction in coal generation in southern zones, that determine lower
prices compared to the northern zone. In the short term, differentials
are expected to remain consistent with last year's results, with a
general alignment between zones. Looking ahead to 2030, the ongoing
integration of RES into the energy mix is expected to amplify this
disparity, leading to greater price differentials in the southern zones.
The market parity for renewables should be sustained by commodity prices
higher than in the past, which bolster quotations. After 2030, the
decrease in CAPEX and the high CO2 levels support the IRR, but increase
the impact of overgeneration risk, especially for projects in southern
and island areas. In the coming years contraction in electricity demand
and increase in import affect gas plants market competitiveness reducing
their marginality compared to recent years peak, favored by high
commodities prices. Capture CSS for the average CCGT 53% efficiency
should align to 2023 results, around 10 €/MWh. After 2025 despite the
entrance of new thermal capacity through the CM, marginality should
remain stable around 10-15 €/MWh as electrification in final consumption
continue and import flows gradually reduce. In the Reference scenario
gas-fired generation is expected to remain at the backbone of the
national energy mix even after renewables become the first production
source through the next decades, until 2031 when RES become the main
resource in the mix. Its share in the generation mix should decrease
progressively but stay close to 30% of the national electricity needs
until 2040. Mutated market conditions, triggered by the geopolitical
tensions and contingent factors witnessed during the last year two
years, combined with implications of market design and regulation
evolution (XBID and Terna's Incentive scheme) unveil a changed market
landscape context that is expected to permanently change the structure
of revenue flows for gas-fired power plants. As observed in the last two
years operativity for CCGTs is expected to be concentrated for over 80%
of total production on the DAM as ASM, in particular the ex-ante phase,
contracted significantly ( -85% compared to 2021 ASM ex-ante volumes).
Operativity has shifted toward the balancing phase, which remain stable
despite Terna's intervention, in the coming years as the presence of RES
in the generation increase BM might provide further support for thermal
units marginality. Implementation of TIDE in 2025 may sustain market
revenues for CCGTs, through new service remuneration that are current
mandatory as "Riserva Primaria" and possible relaxation of operativity
constraints depending on XBID participation. Evolution of market
regulation and generation mix structure may favour potential upside for
thermal units on ASM supporting their revenues, furthermore greater
balancing needs brought by the integration of RES in the energy mix are
expected to boost operativity on ASM for some specific nodal needs,
mainly in southern zone as long as flexible capacity development lack
behind.

The scenario analysis is complemented by an assessment of the economic
viability of the current thermal generation fleet given the expected
market scenario. The evaluation is aimed to highlighting potential
financial viability challenges that may arise, emphasizing the need to
consider extending a Capacity Remuneration Mechanism solely for existing
capacity or substituting unfinished projects. As highlighted by Terna in
the latest adequacy report, over the past three years, despite the
operational capacity market, system adequacy has still been at risk in
the face of extreme weather conditions such as those experienced in the
summer of 2022. the significant reduction in hydroelectric production
compounded with increased unavailability of water-cooled thermal power
plants and limited imported energy due to French nuclear unavailability.
The proposed changes are intended for auctions related to the years
2025-2027, scheduled for the summer of 2024, with recent DCO 102/2024
published by ARERA the new capacity market premium cap should be fixed
at an higher cap than the previous auctions to take into consideration
the revaluation of inflation index by ECB.

The new long-term scenario analysis of MBS takes into consideration the
latest trends of the Italian system evolution, it peers itself with the
Fit-for-55 targets in 2030 and discusses the possible paths towards
2050. Market simulations are extended beyond 2040 by explicitly
modelling the market fundamentals through deterministic techniques and
by assuming an inertial evolution, in line with the average 2030 -- 2040
trajectory, for renewables installation sustained by BESS technologies,
reduction in gas generation quota in the energy mix, electrification of
consumptions and a proportional gird development on top of Terna
development plan. All the elaborations are done considering the market
structure and rules as known of today.

The resulting trajectory lacks behind the Net Zero targets: by 2050,
only 85% of Italian electricity demand is expected to be met by
renewable generation, while the residual demand would be covered by
flexible and efficient gas generation, still needed by the system for
adequacy reasons. Further contraction in operating hours (morning and
evening peaks) impose the need of an explicit remuneration mechanism to
support their economic viability. Renewables are expected to become the
predominant marginal technology and market prices are expected to become
less dependent on gas generation costs and more related to LCOE of
renewable technologies as their marginal quota reach 40% of the yearly
hours

For evaluating price dynamics beyond 2050 (2050-2060 horizon),we assume
an extension of 2050 results taking into account the uncertainty of
available information for an explicit evaluation of the very long-term.
2040-2060 scenarios will be carefully evaluated in future updates in
order to discuss the economic sustainability of policy scenarios
implementing the net zero target.

The reference scenario predicts a 0.4% year-on-year GDP growth in 2024,
with a stronger increase of 1% in 2025, driven by an anticipated easing
of financial conditions. In 2024, a weak industrial sector and limited
investments are expected to weigh on the economy. However, a gradual
easing of monetary policies in the second half of the year, along with
positive wage dynamics, should contribute to growth in 2025. In the
worst-case scenario, if inflationary pressures persist, GDP is projected
to decline by 0.1% year-on-year in 2024 and see a modest increase of
0.3% in 2025. Conversely, the best-case scenario, characterized by
accelerated disinflation and a recovery in investments, would result in
GDP growth of up to 1.2% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025.

In our Reference and Best scenarios, economic growth would gradually
realign to the previously projected path, sustained by the effective
implementation of the NRRP measures, the recovery of the global economy,
and an acceleration of the green transition reforms. In the Worst

implementation would keep economic growth near zero and lead to a
failure of the green transition.

monetary policy may revert to easing supporting investments growth. The
European Central Bank (ECB) has in fact decided to start a slow path of
rate reduction, with an initial cut of 0.25 percentage points from the
previous 4.75%. However, geopolitical uncertainty and the risk of

### LNG

::: callout-main
\*\* GLOBAL LNG DEMAND IS SEEN AS GROWING STEADY IN THE SHORT TERM, WITH
A NOTABLE DISPARITY IN GROWTH RATE SHOWCASED BETWEEN THE ASIAN AND
EUROPEAN BLOCS. DELAYS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF LIQUEFACTION AND
REGASIFICATION CAPACITY, INDUCED BY LOW PRICES, COULD TRANSLATE IN
RENEWED DEMAND-SUPPLY TENSIONS IN 2025-2026. THERE IS A HIGH PROPABILITY
OF AN OVERSUPPLED MARKET POST-2026 LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR LNG PRICES
NORMALIZING IN THE MEDIUM TO LONG-TERM \*\*
:::

![](figs/12_World_LNG_Demand.png)

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 24-25 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Global LNG demand growth is forecasted to grow with an average growth
rate close to 5% in both 2024 and 2025. European and Chinese gas demand
will primarily drive this uprise, as LNG intake is expected to
accelerate in the short-term, in response to expansion of regasification
capacity, and to support the transition from coal. Despite 2024 LNG
supply growth being limited globally, reduced competition between Europe
and Asia, and the expected new capacity entering the market in 2025, are
likely to guarantee adequate demand coverage. Should new liquefaction
plants construction and FIDs suffer further delays, renewed tensions
could emerge in winter 2025-2026 leading to price upswings.
:::

Starting from 2026, LNG demand growth is expected to gradually slowdown,
stabilizing just below 5% y/y, consistently with rising renewable energy
production and improved energy efficiency measures. Conditional on the

the market by 2026, driven by US and Qatar, contributing to almost
eliminating the risk of market tightness.

LONG TERM, WE ANTICIPATE FURTHER DEMAND REDUCTION DUE TO EUROPE'S
DECARBONIZATION EFFORTS, LEADING TO A LOWER TTF PRICE TRAJECTORY NEARING

#### 24-25 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
In our Reference scenario, the 2024 TTF yearly average is projected to
stay below 40 €/MWh, with the persistence of subdued demand weighing on
prices. Europe LNG import capacity is poised to expand by further 30 Bcm
in 2024 enabling additional LNG arrivals, crucial to maintain market
equilibrium in the short-term and to structurally adapt to the absence
of Russian piped gas.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}

From 2026 onwards, a further normalization is anticipated as a result of
the significant deployment of new liquefaction capacity. Assuming a
progressive growth of global LNG supplies alongside an acceleration of
the energy transition, European gas prices are projected to steadily
decrease towards 30 €/MWh by 2028.
:::
:::

:: callout-item ::: callout-left \#### 31-40 {.unnumbered} :::

The European decarbonization process would keep reducing gas demand,
successively pressuring the price action back towards the 25 €/MWh
long-term equilibrium. Only in the High scenario, persisting
geopolitical and commercial tensions would leave commodities shortages
unresolved, leaving prices just below 45 €/MWh in the long-term.
Effective green policies supported by economic growth may lead prices

EUROPE GAS FLOWS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE INTERRUPTION OF RUSSIAN PIPED GAS
SUPPLIES. THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF THE OLT LNG REGASIFICATION FACILITY
IN ITALY ADDS PRESSURE IN THE VERY NEAR-TERM. IN THE LONG-TERM, THE

![](figs/14_Spread_TTF_PSV.png)

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 24-25 {.unnumbered}

::: callout-right
The PSV-TTF spread is expected to stay just below 3 €/MWh in 2024
following the closure of the OLT LNG regasification facility which
increases the Italy’s reliance on piped gas flows from Norway via Passo
Gries. Fluctuations throughout the year are anticipated to be in line
with seasonality.
:::

We anticipate a 2024 PSV yearly average below 40 €/MWh, amid constrained
gas demand recovery. The shift towards savings and efficiency weights on
distribution network consumption, while subdued growth in the
energy-intensive sector limits the industrial demand adding to a
lower-than-average thermoelectric gas demand. Delays in the
commissioning of the Ravenna FSRU have also hampered gas demand recovery
expectations. In the event of renewed tensions on LNG and TTF prices
arising in winter 25-26, the PSV would follow.

### Logistics Costs for Italian Gas-Fired Units

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 24-27 {.unnumbered}

::: callout-right
The 2023 logistic cost for Italian gas-fired units averaged 4 €/MWh amid
the increase of the CRVOS (which pays storage injections incentives),
CRVBL (which covers the charges associated with the gas system balancing
activity) and the CVU (which covers variable charges and it’s linked to
the gas price trend) components. The variable logistic cost remains
around 4 €/MWh short-term due to the essential CRVOS component for
storage injection incentives, though thermoelectric producers could
request over 60% exemption. The ARERA Resolution 263/2024 temporary
fixes the CRVBL component (which covers the charges associated with the
gas system balancing activity) equal to zero from January 2025, as a
result of the improved natural gas price scenario. As a precautionary
measure, we assume a gradual return to historical average levels in the
second half of 2025 to account for the volatility of the current
transport cost environment, which reverberates on prices consequently.

![](figs/17_CO2_Allowances_Price.png)

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 24-25 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
In our Reference scenario, the 2024 CO2 price average is projected to
stay near 70 €/ton, driven by the gradual implementation of the ETS
system reform. The phasing out of free allowances for the aviation
sector, reaching 50% of the total in 2025, along with the planned
removal of 90 Mln permits from the market in 2024, are expected to begin
exerting upward pressure on allowances prices by curtailing supply. From
2025 onwards, the progressive inclusion of the maritime transport sector
will further boost overall demand. Concerns remain regarding the
underlying demand recovery, which is anticipated to be limited over the
next couple of years due to a slow economic growth.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The widening of the supply-demand gap should become evident starting
from 2026, as the maritime sector integrates into the ETS system and the
phasing out of free allowances for aviation reaches full implementation.
In addition, by 2030, the reinforcement of the Market Stability Reserve
and the increase of the Linear Reduction Factor up to 4.4% will
contribute to further tightening the market. As a result, the CO2 price
is expected to accelerate towards 110 €/ton on average by 2030.

#### 31-50 {.unnumbered}

By 2034 the removal of free allowances for sectors covered by the CBAM
will reach full implementation, inducing a further increase in
allowances demand. The long-term targets would hinge upon the effective
efficiency of the ETS System, with the CO2 price expected to exceed 120
€/ton in the Reference scenario by 2040, and potentially accelerate to
just below 150 €/ton in the Low scenario, under the assumption of
stricter decarbonization efforts in Europe to accelerate the prices
increase.

across all three scenarios, in response to the sharp decline in CO2
prices in evidence in the second half of 2023 and in the first quarter
of 2024. A rebound in allowances demand and, consequently, in average
prices in the post-2024 period, is envisaged.

In 2015, the approval of the European guidelines on capacity allocation

The current zonal configuration derives from the base case proposed by
Terna in compliance with the CACM. Differences compared to the previous
configuration: (i) elimination of the limited production poles, (ii)
inclusion of a new bidding zone corresponding to the Calabria region,
(iii) displacement of the Umbria region from the Centre-North zone to

electricity needs is as follows: North (57%), Central-North (9%),
Central-South (17%), South (7%), Calabria (2%), Sicily (6%), Sardinia

:::

::: callout-right
Continuing the trend registered in 2023 and in the first half of 2024,
net import from neighboring countries is going to be higher than
historical average. This is manly due to French nuclear power production
recovery, after two years operation and maintenance stops, recovery in
hydro production in Switzerland, and a general delay in European demand
increase. Net import is expected to reach 49.7 TWh in 2024, and
stabilize also in 2025.

::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Net imports flows are assumed to slowly decrease in the second half of
the decade to around 45 TWh in 2030. This is due to: (i) recovering
switching conditions and the partial dismission of the nuclear and coal-
fired capacity in France and Germany, (ii) demand recovery at European
level lead by electrification, and (iii) the achievement of 2030
renewable targets in other European countries, which increases
electricity production from RES. Moreover, the go-live of the
Tunisia-Sicily cable by the end of 2028, will reduce the net import
balance by adding more than 3.5 TWh of export flows.

The phase-out of nuclear and coal-fired units in continental Europe
could lead to a further net import decrease in the 2030s, until 13 TWh
ca. in 2040. The slight increase in net import seen from 2035 is due to
an estimated reduction (1 TWh ca.) in the export flows towards Tunisia,
following the Tunisian system development plan. In the High scenario,
net imports remain sustained as switching conditions only partially
improve and no significant nuclear/coal-fired dismission is supposed in
continental Europe.

By the end of the year, 36 GW of solar and 13 GW of wind capacity are
expected to be operational. The potential for renewable energy
development is assessed based on recent trends, considering both
bureaucratic and technical obstacles. This analysis projects an increase
of 6.5 GW in solar capacity and 1.5 GW in wind capacity between the end
of 2024 and 2027. These estimates are aligned with the installation
growth trends observed in recent years, driven by the completion of the
authorization process, Fer 1 incentives, signed PPAs, and merchant

Market parity conditions and FerX incentive scheme will accelerate
long-term targets achievement. In the Reference case, there is an
ambitious plan for the development of renewables with an estimated 50 GW
of solar and 16 GW of wind capacity by 2030, allowing to reach almost
50% of the energy demand. This scenario assumes a market-driven
evolution of the sector. Low scenario reach 63 GW of solar and 20 GW of
wind capacity by 2030, achieved through a faster decrease in technology
costs and more favorable economic conditions boosting investment in new
RES capacity.
:::

The Reference scenario predicts a continued increase in renewables
penetration, with solar and wind capacity expected to reach 80 GW and 27
GW respectively, by 2040. A faster transition towards long-term
decarbonization goals may be possible with greater-than-anticipated
investments in grid infrastructure and high-capacity energy storage
solutions. In this best case, more than 105 GW of total RES capacity
within 2030, and 146 GW by 2040 might be achieved.

BAU market conditions and moderate renewable penetration lead to a
minimum risk of overgeneration in Reference and High scenario, while a

::: callout-right
Greater penetration of renewable energy sources expected after 2027.
Consequently, the possibility of overgeneration starting to increase
could result in almost 2 TWh of excess electricity in the Low scenario
by 2030. The curtailment effect may be emphasized in certain local grid
conditions. Moreover, during this decade, overgeneration is likely to be
exacerbated by the rapid development of renewable energy sources in the
southern regions of the country and the lack of adequate grid
reinforcement.

In order to effectively manage the growing penetration of renewable
energy sources and the associated overgeneration phenomena, the 2030s
will require significant investments in grid reinforcements and high-
capacity energy storage solutions. These measures will be crucial for
balancing the grid and ensuring stable energy supply, especially in
regions that are particularly prone to overgeneration. This excess
energy production could provide opportunities for the installation of
electrolysis capacity, which would not only help to take advantage of
excess energy production but also support ongoing investments in RES.

in the system, mainly in the islands. Grid investments and BESS are
going to be insufficient to mitigate the problem, creating favorable
conditions for green hydrogen, installed electrolysis capacity could
reach almost 0.5 GW in the Reference scenario, concetrated in Sardinia.
In the long-term, electrolysis capacity can effectively address
overgeneration by providing a means to store excess renewable energy.
Additionally, by increasing demand during periods of high RES
production, it can help sustain prices and mitigate the cannibalization
effect, particularly during the advanced transition phase.

Network congestions are generally not a major issue on the mainland.
Electricity demand still below the historical level and gradual growth
of renewable generation result in lower prices in the southern regions,

:::

::: callout-right
The spread between PUN and southern market zones (here represented by
the South zone) is expected to mantain recent historical levels in the
short-term, with Soutern zone at discount. Dynamic driven by a general
reduction in electricity demand and a growing share of RES in the
generation mix, resulting in lower prices compared to Northern zones,
where despite the increase in import flows CCGTs remain necessary to
close demand fixing on average higher prices.
:::

#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

In the Reference and Low case integration of renewables technologies
contributes to further widen the spread, notwithstanding network
interventions. In the High scenario, the spread is reabsorbed as
renewable development is more contained switching conditions for
gas-fired units gradually improve until in 2030, when coal generation

In the Reference case, the great penetration of renewables in southern
regions widens back the spread in the first half of the 2030s, providing
the market signal for new electrochemical BESS to enter the market and
for new grid investment to be realized. In the Low scenario, the
anticipated and greater development of storage and network investments
helps reduce the spread instead. Continuos RES development widen again

:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}

::: callout-right
Market competition is expected to increase with the import flows
stabilization from the northern borders, the rise in renewable capacity,
and the entry of new high-efficiency CCGTs, which were acquired through
Capacity Market auctions. These factors will keep the baseload CSS in
negative territory. In the Low scenario, where renewable development is
greater and the competition within the thermoelectric sector is
stronger, this effect will be even more pronounced, with CSS averaging
around -3 €/MWh.

After 2030, a significant decrease in net import flows and the exit of
some ageing capacity allow existing CCGTs (53%-efficiency) to remain the
marginal technology in the system for at least 85% of the hours, with
the baseload CSS below -2 €/MWh for all the horizon. Greater renewable
penetration in the Low scenario, maintain the baseload CSS below 4 €/MWh
also in the long-term. In the High case scenario, reduced renewable

Captured CSS evolve depending on the zone mix, with southern bidding
zones suffering the high operativity of coal-fired units and significant
risk of operation at loss, while CCGT producing in the northern zone
manage to guarantee positive margins at around 11 €/MWh , favored by the
current market dynamics.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

As renewable capacity increases, existing units tend to concentrate
their operations during evening hours to maximize captured margins. The
high-efficiency gas-fired capacity captured CSS is subject to
competitive market conditions as new projects enter the market with
support from the latest CM auction. Despite this, the high efficiency of
these projects enables them to maintain an average captured margin of 10
€/MWh.

:::
:::

#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}

Increasing pace of installations and the consequent cannibalization and
overgeneration effects -- only partially limited by power intensive
storages and grid developments -- have an impact on zonal captured
prices, which trend diverges compared to baseload prices, decreasing
below 95 €/MWh also in the Northern zones.
:::

The increasing occurrence of overgeneration serves as a market signal
for the entry of energy-intensive storages, which partially mitigate the
cannibalization phenomenon. After 2030, the cannibalization effect
becomes more noticeable in the captured prices of solar energy,
parcularly in southern market zones with higher renewable penetration,

### Investment costs and IRR of Solar and Wind

**THE INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE PV MODULES MARKET DRIVES DOWN
INVESTMENT COSTS FOR SOLAR IN THE MID AND LONG TERM, EVEN THOUGH GRID
CONNECTION AND LAND COSTS MAY RISE. CONSEQUENTLY, THE IRR FOR PV
INVESTMENTS IS EXPECTED TO STABILIZE AT AROUND 7%. TURBINES AND
INVERTERS CONSTITUTE 75% OF WIND CAPEX, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY €1.5
MILLION. AS THE COSTS OF WIND TECHNOLOGIES DECREASE, OVERALL CAPEX WILL
REDUCE, LEADING TO A STABILIZATION OF THE IRR AT AROUND 7%**
:::

![](figs/59_Capex_Wind.png)

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### Solar investment costs and IRR {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The high competition in the PV modules market, predominantly led by
Chinese manufacturers, has driven the costs of PV modules down to around
€150,000 per MW. Nearly 30% of the total cost for a module is attributed
to polysilicon, a relatively inexpensive but highly volatile material.
Other critical materials with high demand and low availability, such as
silver, could potentially increase the price of the technology in the
future. Generally, due to market competitiveness, PV modules account for
only 15% of the total solar CAPEX.

Two significant costs impact the total CAPEX for solar technologies. The
cost of connecting to the grid, which varies greatly by project, is
expected to rise in the coming years. This is due to the increasing
number of projects in remote locations, complicating high-voltage grid
connections. Additionally, the cost of land acquisition or rental, which
constitutes nearly 8% of the total cost, has increased in recent years.
The anticipated acceleration of new installations in the coming years
may further drive up land demand for solar projects, as available sites
diminish, thereby increasing rental costs.

Other residual costs, such as design, administration, internal
development, engineering, mitigation works, and contingencies, are
highly project-dependent and account for nearly 30% of the total solar
CAPEX. This cost structure typically results in an IRR of around 7%
(base case considering South zone, pre-tax captured prices, 30 years
time horizon) for solar projects, with regional variations according to
different zonal captured prices.

For agri-voltaic projects, a markup of 20%-40% on the total investment
cost must be applied, leading to a lower expected IRR of around 6%.

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### Wind investment costs and IRR {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The primary cost for a wind plant is the turbine and inverter, which
account for 60% of the total cost. Grid connection represents 10% of the
wind CAPEX, which is approximately €1.5 million for an onshore wind
project. In the short and mid-term, technology costs are unlikely to
decrease due to the low rate of new installations, which limits the
potential for economies of scale. However, as the technology matures,
particularly in Northern countries where installation rates are higher,
there may be a reduction in technology costs. Despite this, the CAPEX
for a wind project is expected to remain above €1 million until 2040.
This cost structure typically results in an IRR of around 7% (base case
considering South zone, pre-tax captured prices, 20 years time horizon)
for onshore wind projects, with regional variations according to
different zonal captured prices.
