# Frame of Reference

REF-E scenarios over the time horizon 2024-2050 (with projections up to 2060) are elaborated by MBS Consulting experts on the base of proprietary suites and market knowledge. Econometric and structural models, as well as our expert sensitiveness, detailed knowledge of regulation, and accurate monitoring of market outcomes underlie our elaborations. 

Gas and electricity forecasts consider the diverse geopolitical and economic hypothesis deriving from the regulatory, financial and fundamentals adjustments to the disruption generated both from the pandemic and the Ukrainian war, which are seen as key determinants of the future equilibrium of the energy markets.

Current scenario update incorporates an evolution of climate variables in line with the historical average trend.

In this perspective, we defined three scenarios:

-   The **High Case scenario** is characterized by permanently high fuels and power prices amid negative or zero economic growth depressing investments and weighing on the energy transition process.  
-   In the **Reference scenario**, is characterized by the energy transition process progress leading to a diversification of energy sources supported by the existing policies. This, combined with efficiency maintains the energy market on a transformation path. The economic growth slowly recovers over the next two   years.  

-   The **Low Case scenario** would materialize in the event of favorable weather conditions and a fast energy transition, supported by low inflation and a faster economic recovery, reducing power and fossil fuels demand over the next few years. This would limit energy prices upside potential and then fuel a downward acceleration.

## Without reforms, how far could the Italian market advance in decarbonization?

### Key Insights {.unnumbered}

The 2021-2023 period put a lot of pressure on the energy markets in Italy and Europe, underpinning the urgency to ensure diversification and efficiency of energy supplies. More than ever, decarbonization of the electricity sector by increasing the share of renewable and other low-carbon sources in the energy mix is at the heart of the energy policies applied across Europe and requires substantial overhaul of the energy systems. The transformation is already taking place guided by favorable market conditions driving new investments. Renewables and energy storage solutions are gaining traction in most of the European markets, including Italy. 

Italy aims to embrace ambitious decarbonization goals for 2030, indicating a nearly twofold increase in the current share of renewables in electricity demand. The surge is foreseen due to expected rapid electrification trends and will necessitate concurrent technological and infrastructural development. One question remains: is the Italian market prepared to fully embrace the transition? Can it facilitate the growth and integration of renewable source at reduced costs for consumers and investors? Which is the role of the regulatory framework and how far the system could advance without reforms? 

MBS delves into these critical topics in its latest market scenario report for Italy. Starting from eased short-term gas market dynamics and favourable renewable electricity production that contributed to keeping power prices across Europe on a downward trend since the beginning of 2024, the report explores the range of risks and opportunities expected in the long run on pure merchant basis. The analysis addresses the discrepancies between the expected market trends and national decarbonization objectives, outlining the gaps that must be bridged moving forward.

Short-term GDP growth continues to be modest, supported by a gradual rebound in industrial production driven by wage trends and anticipated monetary policy adjustments. In the Reference scenario GDP growth is expected to near 0.4% year-on-year in 2024, followed by a more robust increase of 1% in 2025, driven by an anticipated easing of financial conditions. A relatively weak industrial sector and restrained investment weigh on 2024 performance. However, a gradual easing of monetary policies in the second half of the year, coupled with positive wage dynamics, should bolster growth in 2025. In High case scenario in which the inflationary pressures persist, GDP could decline by 0.1% year-on-year in 2024, recovering slightly in 2025 (+0.3%). The Low case scenario is characterized by accelerated disinflation and rebound in investments, GDP growth could reach 1.2% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025. In the longer-term growth will rely mainly on factors such as the path of disinflation, improved financing conditions, and the successful implementation of the NRRP. In both Reference and Low scenarios, economic growth is assumed to be supported by the successful execution of NRRP initiatives, global economic recovery, and expedited green transition reforms. In the High scenario, pressure from fiscal policies and shortcomings in NRRP implementation would likely keep economic growth stagnant, jeopardizing the progress of green transition.

Given the current competition in LNG supplies, as well as the level of European domestic gas reserves and demand, notable surge in gas prices is considered improbable until the upcoming winter season (excluding worsening of the geopolitical context). Nevertheless, the prolonged period of low prices is causing delays in the construction of liquefaction capacity, potentially leading to renewed tensions between supply and demand. Despite this, the possibility of a new bullish cycle cannot be overlooked, particularly starting from the winter of 2025-2026. From 2026 on, LNG demand growth is expected to slow down, settling below 5% annually as a result of rise in renewable energy production and energy efficiency measures. A new wave of liquefaction capacity is expected to commence operation by 2026, mostly led by the United States and Qatar. The capacity expansion is expected to significantly mitigate the risk of market scarcity.

Geopolitical tensions have not yet impacted the gas market in this scenario, hence they are not factored into current pricing. However, any further escalation in geopolitical tensions remains a significant risk factor that could disrupt the short-term equilibrium.
Low gas demand throughout Europe in 2023 left storages well above historical averages, causing gas prices to decline. Without resurgence in electricity demand resulting in higher thermoelectric gas demand, the 2024 storage injection demand is unlikely to affect gas prices in the coming months. The Italian gas price remains closely linked to the European hub, particularly the TTF. However, the temporary shutdown of the OLT facility has disrupted Italian imports thus leading near-term forecasts to suggest broader deviations from the TTF.

In our Reference scenario, the yearly averages for both PSV and TTF in 2024 stay below 40 €/MWh, reflecting the effects of limited gas demand recovery, shift towards savings and efficiency reduces pressure on distribution networks. Additionally, subdued growth in the energy-intensive sector limits industrial demand, resulting in lower-than-average thermoelectric gas demand. Delays in commissioning of Ravenna FSRU have dampened expectations for gas demand recovery. if tensions reemerge on LNG and TTF prices during winter of 2025-2026, PSV is projected to reach 33 €/MWh. In Low scenario gas prices remain close to 25 €/MWh in 2024, assuming faster energy transition and reduction of global gas demand, the price will settle at near 15 €/MWh by 2026. Under the High case scenario, gas prices are forecasted to average 50 €/MWh due to the compounding effects of economic stagnation, decreased investments, and an unstable geopolitical environment. The PSV is expected to align with the mid-term normalization of European gas prices towards 30 €/MWh by 2030, reflecting a gradual rebalancing of global gas demand-supply dynamics amid the anticipated acceleration of the energy transition. In the very long-term PSV price should converge to an equilibrium of 25 €/MWh in the Reference scenario and 10 €/MWh in the Low case, while it should settle above 40 €/MWh in the High scenario.
The enhancement into law of the ETS system reform confirms its pivotal role in sustaining the decarbonization process. Introduction of new measures occurs amidst weakened macroeconomic fundamentals, extended period of low demand and bearish trends of CO2 prices since Q2-23. A range of factors are estimated to have contributed to the decrease in demand such as diminished levels of industrial production (notably in energy-intensive sectors), increased energy costs from the previous year prompting greater savings, higher inflation rates, and a restrictive monetary policy that impacted economic growth adversely. In our Reference scenario, the 2024 average CO2 price is projected to approach 65 €/ton, driven by the gradual implementation of the ETS system reform. The phasing out of free allowances for the aviation sector, accounting for 50% of the total by 2025, and the scheduled removal of 90 million permits from the market in 2024, are expected to push allowances prices upward as supply reduces. Additionally, the gradual inclusion of the maritime transport sector starting from 2025, will further increase overall demand and prices are expected to reach 107 €/ton in 2030. Main concerns regard demand recovery, expected to be limited in the next couple of years due to slow economic growth. The Low case scenario incorporate a swift economic recover coupled with challenges in decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors like aviation and maritime transport. These factors lead to a substantial increase in demand volume, pushing the CO2 price to surpass 130 €/ton before 2030.  If further demand disruptions arise due to elevated energy costs, reduced industrial output, and delays in implementing new regulations, the High case scenario might materialize:  ETS price that fails to rebound, staying under 50 €/ton in the short term and under 75 €/ton until 2030. The effectiveness of the ETS System plays a crucial role in reaching the long-term emission reduction targets, with the CO2 price projected to surpass 120 €/ton in the Reference scenario by 2040 and potentially rise to just under 150 €/ton in the Low scenario or near 90 €/ton in High scenario.

In 2023, electricity consumption dropped to 306 TWh, reflecting a 3% decline from 2022 . A slight recovery of 2024 macroeconomic outlook, combined with improved end-use consumption electrification, is expected to increase consumption to 312 TWh in the Reference scenario. A more optimistic economic view could bring to 314 TWh as in the Low case scenario, while a more pessimistic view and delay in final use electrification is foreseen in the High scenario, 310 TWh. In the coming years supportive economic measure driven NRRP and unfold of electrification potential could determine a possible fork between 327 TWh in scenario High and  358 TWh in Low case,  containment in efficiency and moderate economic growth are expected in Reference case with an electricity demand of 339 TWh in 2030. In the very long-term a successful electrification trajectory and stable economic outlook could see consumption reach 377 TWh in 2040 in Low scenario, a partial upside of this trend is foreseen in Reference scenario with 364 TWh, while the structural delay in High scenario result in an electricity demand of 340 TWh.

General contraction of electricity demand in European countries, recovery in hydro generation after the severe drought of 2022 and the first half of 2023 and enhanced availability of France nuclear plants favored an increase in net import flow in 2023, +15 % y/y reaching 53 TWh. In the coming years still contained electricity demand, increase in electricity import capacity at the Northern border support by the commissioning of the new 1,200 MW HVDC connecting the Piossasco (Italy) and Grand-Ile (France) electrical substations, operational since August 2023, will further contribute to supporting power flows from France to Italy. Furthermore, high electricity imports to Italy are also favoured by the PUN seen as stabilizing well above other European electricity prices (particularly the French and the Swiss ones). In fact, the average spread between the Italian power price and those of northern borders nearly doubled over the last five years. Moving toward 2030 partial achievements of decarbonization targets in European countries,  gradual phase-out of coal-fired generation in continental Europe and reduction in availability of France nuclear fleet are going to reshape import flows toward Italy, defining a declining trend expected to reach 32 TWh in 2030 and 13 TWh in 2040, if investments are not made in new nuclear generation capacity.

During 2023, a notable increase in renewable installation rate (+5.7 GW compared to 1.5 GW/y during the last 5 years), driven by solar technologies, marks a further step towards the net zero path in the long run. 2023 momentum is expected to enhance over the coming years with a yearly increase up to 6 GW (4.5 GW of solar and 1.5 GW of wind) in the Low scenario and 3 GW (2 GW of solar and 1 GW of wind)  in the Reference case, still below the NIECP average annual target of 8 GW necessary to reach the 2030 targets. Improved regulation, gradual reduction in investment costs and ETS price signals should support the market parity conditions in the long run. A draft decree, the so called FER X, proposes contracts for differences that target the 2030 objectives, limiting the space for market initiatives, with a quota of almost 70 GW (45 GW solar and 16 GW wind) to be allocated between 2024 and 2028. The decree now under review by the European Commission, aligns with the objectives for 2030 of NIECP, future update are going to integrate this evaluation when defined.

Renewable generation has seen a recovery during 2023 mainly driven by hydro production +36% y/y, while wind and solar production increase by 15% and 10% respectively. Despite recover in hydro generation the evolution of climate dynamic are expecting to affect production, aligning yearly results with recent years average, around 45 TWh. In the coming years the expectation of a slow recovery in electricity demand, below 2019 level until 2026, and a sustained pace of renewable installations are going to increase RES quota in the generation mix, reaching in 2030 almost 50% in Reference scenario and 60% in Low case respectively, while it should remain close to 40% in the High case. In our scenario zonal distribution of the new capacity follow the patterns revealed by Terna’s connection request database, and new utility scale projects are expected to be concentrated mostly in the Southern macrozone and the two islands. Growth of small-scale distributed renewables for self-consumption should be concentrated in the Norther area following the historical path with 6% annual increase.

Grid expansion reflect Terna’s 2023 Development Plan indications. In the Reference case reinforcements are assumed operational already in the 2020s but the main improvements to resolve zonal congestions are expected to be completed in the 2030s – Tyrrhenian link and Adriatic link as well as first portions of the Hypergrid. Faster penetration of renewable energy in the Low case would require the realization of the main projects even before 2030, while the slower system transition in the High case postpone the key investments to the middle of the 2030s. 

By 2030, significant overgeneration and curtailment risks are expected to arise in the Southern zone and the Islands, which will prompt a surge in new electrochemical storage projects. Depending on the alternative scenarios of RES and grid development trajectories, these dynamics may be accelerated or delayed, with expected 16 GW of storage capacity in Reference scenario and 23 GW in Low case. Long-term development of batteries should follow the opportunities for time-shifting applications on the day-ahead market, with investments in power intensive electrochemical batteries can be in-the-money in the medium-term, with revenue streams deriving mainly from the participation in the balancing phase of the Ancillary Services Market and a long-term capacity remuneration through specific projects. Investments in merchant energy intensive storage batteries are likely to be attractive only in the long-term when time-shifting applications on the DAM could become economically sustainable thanks to increasing price spread volatility and the presence of overgeneration. In 2040, up to 28 GW of energy intensive batteries are expected to be developed in our Reference scenario and 30 GW in Low case. Regulatory framework is evolving creating new opportunities for batterie, with MACSE a regulated remuneration mechanism designed only for storage systems, Terna pays a fixed remuneration (€/MWh/year) for the operator to provide capacity and 5% of revenues from balancing activities to support storage development, auctions are scheduled for the end of 2024.

The need to boost energy independence in the decarbonization process at European level has placed green hydrogen at the forefront of the European energy strategy (REPowerEU).  It is expected to determine the allocation of substantial funding – way more than the amount currently earmarked – to accelerate the development of a European hydrogen supply chain, improving current cost perspectives of green solutions. But accelerating renewables development poses the risk of structural overgeneration if the development of BESS does not advance concurrently, especially in less interconnected regions and have a high intensity of renewables relative to demand, such as Sardinia and Sicily where economically viable opportunities for competitive green hydrogen consolidate starting from 2035.

During 2023 electricity prices drastically reduce after 2022 peak, -58% averaging 127 €/MWh, the decreasing trend follow gas dynamics, emphasizing electricity price dependency. The relaxation of short-term gas market and increase in renewable electricity production have contributed to maintaining downward pressure on power prices across Europe since the beginning of the year. This trend will continue into 2024 due to improved conditions in the Italian gas market and further expansion of renewable generation, with the 2024 average PUN is expected to approach €100/MWh in Reference scenario and 96 €/MWh in Low case. However, the recovery of CO2 prices in 2025, bolstered by the EU ETS reform potentially coupled with renewed tensions in global gas market supply-demand dynamics depending on delays in LNG liquefaction capacity development, could result in higher electricity prices in 2025 and 2026, with the PUN projected to average close to €110/MWh, in Low scenario reduction in demand and faster transition push prices to 90 €/MWh. Moving toward 2030 integration of renewables technologies in the energy, further reduction in commodities levels and gradual grid improvements push prices at 74 €/MWh Low case, in Reference case a partial delay in decarbonization trajectory and higher PSV determine an average price of 106 €/MWh. In the mid-term renewables penetration, led by solar energy, is expected to strongly affect peak/off-peak dynamics after 2030, when the inversion of price spreads between time slots is expected to occur. With the expected slow electricity demand recovery, the differences in zonal prices will be limited due to reduced transit between market zones. Additionally, abundant electricity imports from the northern borders will further alleviate congestion. Average zonal spread are expected to remain below €1/MWh in the short term, with southern market zones experiencing a higher differential with the PUN. However, after 2026, zonal spreads are anticipated to widen as a result of increasing electricity consumption, combined with accelerated development of renewable energy and a gradual decrease in electricity imports. Over the long term, the significant development of renewable energy sources in the southern macro-zone is expected to drive prices down through the cannibalization of solar technologies. Despite grid improvements, bottlenecks are still expected between the northern and southern zones, resulting in differing price levels in the 2030s. From 2035 onwards, further grid reinforcements are assumed to occur, resulting in a reduction of inter-zonal congestion issues on the mainland. However, criticalities are likely to remain evident in the islands. 

The Law 11/2024, known as DL Energia, mandates that starting from January 1st, 2025, final customers will transition to paying zonal prices based on wholesale market price trends, departing from PUN. The reform is driven by the necessity to implement Capacity Allocation & Congestion Management (CACM) rules, which aim to establish a unified European market by simplifying algorithms, and to create locational signals for both demand and supply. Many aspects still require clarification, particularly the methodologies for implementation, which will play a crucial role in defining the market impact of the reform.

In recent past, prices for renewable technologies have mirrored the fluctuations in commodities markets, benefiting from bullish trends. However, in 2023, prices began to gradually decrease, realigning the zonal differently affected by energy mixes, in particularly the reduction in coal generation in southern zones, that determine lower prices compared to the northern zone. In the short term, differentials are expected to remain consistent with last year's results, with a general alignment between zones. Looking ahead to 2030, the ongoing integration of RES into the energy mix is expected to amplify this disparity, leading to greater price differentials in the southern zones. The market parity for renewables should be sustained by commodity prices higher than in the past, which bolster quotations. After 2030, the decrease in CAPEX and the high CO2 levels support the IRR, but increase the impact of overgeneration risk, especially for projects in southern and island areas.
In the coming years contraction in electricity demand and increase in import affect gas plants market competitiveness reducing their marginality compared to recent years peak, favored by high commodities prices. Capture CSS for the average CCGT 53% efficiency should align to 2023 results, around 10 €/MWh. After 2025 despite the entrance of new thermal capacity through the CM, marginality should remain stable around 10-15 €/MWh as electrification in final consumption continue and import flows gradually reduce. In the Reference scenario gas-fired generation is expected to remain at the backbone of the national energy mix even after renewables become the first production source through the next decades, until 2031 when RES become the main resource in the mix. Its share in the generation mix should decrease progressively but stay close to 30% of the national electricity needs until 2040. Mutated market conditions, triggered by the geopolitical tensions and contingent factors witnessed during the last year two years, combined with implications of market design and regulation evolution (XBID and Terna’s Incentive scheme) unveil a changed market landscape context that is expected to permanently change the structure of revenue flows for gas-fired power plants. As observed in the last two years operativity for CCGTs is expected to be concentrated for over 80% of total production on the DAM as ASM, in particular the ex-ante phase, contracted significantly ( -85% compared to 2021 ASM ex-ante volumes). Operativity has shifted toward the balancing phase, which remain stable despite Terna’s intervention, in the coming years as the presence of RES in the generation increase BM might provide further support for thermal units marginality. Implementation of TIDE in 2025 may sustain market revenues for CCGTs, through new service remuneration that are current mandatory as “Riserva Primaria” and possible relaxation of operativity constraints depending on XBID participation. Evolution of market regulation and generation mix structure may favour potential upside for thermal units on ASM supporting their revenues, furthermore greater balancing needs brought by the integration of RES in the energy mix are expected to boost operativity on ASM for some specific nodal needs, mainly in southern zone as long as flexible capacity development lack behind.

The scenario analysis is complemented by an assessment of the economic viability of the current thermal generation fleet given the expected market scenario. The evaluation is aimed to highlighting potential financial viability challenges that may arise, emphasizing the need to consider extending a Capacity Remuneration Mechanism solely for existing capacity or substituting unfinished projects. As highlighted by Terna in the latest adequacy report, over the past three years, despite the operational capacity market, system adequacy has still been at risk in the face of extreme weather conditions such as those experienced in the summer of 2022. the significant reduction in hydroelectric production compounded with increased unavailability of water-cooled thermal power plants and limited imported energy due to French nuclear unavailability. The proposed changes are intended for auctions related to the years 2025-2027, scheduled for the summer of 2024, with recent DCO 102/2024 published by ARERA the new capacity market premium cap should be fixed at an higher cap than the previous auctions to take into consideration the revaluation of inflation index by ECB.

The new long-term scenario analysis of MBS takes into consideration the latest trends of the Italian system evolution, it peers itself with the Fit-for-55 targets in 2030 and discusses the possible paths towards 2050.  Market simulations are extended beyond 2040 by explicitly modelling the market fundamentals through deterministic techniques and by assuming an inertial evolution, in line with the average 2030 – 2040 trajectory, for renewables installation sustained by BESS technologies, reduction in gas generation quota in the energy mix, electrification of consumptions and a proportional gird development on top of Terna development plan. All the elaborations are done considering the market structure and rules as known of today. 

The resulting trajectory lacks behind the Net Zero targets: by 2050, only 85% of Italian electricity demand is expected to be met by renewable generation, while the residual demand would be covered by flexible and efficient gas generation, still needed by the system for adequacy reasons. Further contraction in operating hours (morning and evening peaks) impose the need of an explicit remuneration mechanism to support their economic viability. Renewables are expected to become the predominant marginal technology and market prices are expected to become less dependent on gas generation costs and more related to LCOE of renewable technologies as their marginal quota reach 40% of the yearly hours 

For evaluating price dynamics beyond 2050 (2050-2060 horizon),we assume an extension of 2050 results taking into account the uncertainty of available information for an explicit evaluation of the very long-term. 2040-2060 scenarios will be carefully evaluated in future updates in order to discuss the economic sustainability of policy scenarios implementing the net zero target.

:::

::: callout-right
In 2023, global LNG demand increased by 2% year-on-year, and it's
predicted to rise by close to 5% annually in both 2024 and 2025, driven
by an increased demand from Europe and China. Despite limited global LNG
supply growth in 2024, competition between Europe and Asia will
decrease, and new capacity coming online in 2024 and 2025 should meet
demand. The balance of LNG demand between Europe and Asia, influenced by
economic activity and weather conditions, along with the progress of new
capacity, will be crucial in determining the global equilibrium in 2025
and 2026, with a growth rate potentially exceeding 7% in the high
scenario.

After 2026, LNG demand growth is expected to slow down to just below 5%

energy efficiency. By 2026, new liquefaction capacity from the US and
Qatar is expected to enter the market, reducing the risk of market
tightness. In the long term, the pressure on the LNG market is expected
to ease further due to the growth in new capacity and the implementation
of green energy commitments.

The TTF 2023 average price settled just above 40 €/MWh, and based on our
reference scenario, expectations for the 2024 yearly average are
projected to establish close to 30 €/MWh. The persistence of subdued
demand, not anticipated to rebound in the short-term, driven by
structural changes in the energy markets and the recovery of RES
production, induce price expectations to remain low. Europe LNG import
capacity is poised to expand by further 30 Bcm in 2024, following the
delay of under construction regasification facilities to that year or
later. The development of European regasification capacity will
increasingly enable additional LNG arrivals, crucial to maintain market
equilibrium in the short-term and to structurally adapt to the absence
of Russian piped gas.

Starting from 2025, there will be a gradual return to normalcy in the
global LNG market due to the deployment of new liquefaction capacity.
This normalization, combined with an accelerated energy transition, is
expected to lead to a steady decrease in European gas prices, reaching
around €30/MWh by 2028. The ongoing decarbonization process in Europe
will continue to reduce gas demand, which will further push prices down
towards the long-term equilibrium of €25/MWh. However, in a scenario of
persisting geopolitical and commercial tensions (High scenario), prices
may remain just below €45/MWh in the long term. Conversely, effective
green policies coupled with economic growth (Low scenario) could drive
prices significantly lower, with the TTF averaging around €10/MWh in the
long term.

The 2023 PSV average price settled just below 45 €/MWh in 2023. In 2024,
we anticipate a decrease in the PSV yearly average, with prices hovering
around 30 €/MWh. This downward revision in PSV forecasts for 2024-2026
can be attributed to constrained gas demand recovery, which, in turn,
stems from various factors. Firstly, gas consumption of the distribution
network is anticipated to remain subdued amid a shift towards savings
and efficiency. Limited growth in the energy-intensive sector and
lower-than-average thermoelectric gas demand driven by sustained
electricity imports and renewable electricity production on the rebound,
will further limit national gas consumption. Delays in the commissioning
of the Ravenna FSRU have also hampered gas demand recovery, falling
short of initial expectations.

In the Reference scenario, the average CO2 price in 2024 is expected to
reach around €65/ton. The aviation sector will see a reduction in free
allowances, reaching 50% of the total by 2025, and 90 million permits
will be removed from the market in 2024, both of which will limit supply
and push prices upward. Additionally, starting from 2025, the inclusion
of the maritime transport sector will further increase demand. However,
concerns persist about effective demand recovery due to anticipated slow
economic growth over the next few years.

phasing out of free allowances for aviation reaches full implementation.
By 2030, the reinforcement of the Market Stability Reserve and the
increase of the Linear Reduction Factor up to 4.4% will contribute to
further tightening the market. CO2 prices are expected to accelerate,

#### 24-25 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
In 2024 and 2025, net import is going to be higher than historical
average, thanks to the recovery of French nuclear power production after
two years operation and maintenance stops, recovery in hydraulicity and
a general delay in demand increase. Net import is expected to reach 49.7
TWh in 2024 and reduce at 47 TWh in 2025.
:::

::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Net imports flows are assumed to slowly decrease in the second half of
the decade to around 32 TWh in 2030. This is due to: (i) recovering
switching conditions and the partial dismission of the nuclear and coal-
fired capacity in France and Germany -- and considering also a BAU
approach in estimang the achievement of 2030 renewable targets in other
European countries; (ii) the go-live of the Tunisia-Sicily cable, that
reduces the net import balance by adding more than 3.5 TWh of export
flows .

The phase-out of nuclear and coal-fired units in continental Europe
could lead to a further net import decrease in the 2030s, until 13 TWh
ca. in 2040. The slight increase in net import seen from 2035 is due to
an estimated reduction (1 TWh ca.) in the export flows towards Tunisia,
following the Tunisian system development plan. In the High scenario,
net imports remain sustained as switching conditions only partially
improve and no significant nuclear/coal-fired dismission is supposed in
continental Europe.

### Baseload CSS for Existing CCGT Units

::: callout-main
**BASELOAD CSS EXPECTED TO DECREASE IN THE SHORT-TERM AS IMPORT AND RES
GENERATION AFFECT CCGTS PRODUCTION. IN MID- AND LONG-TERM VALUES
EXPECTED TO STABILIZE BETWEEN -1 AND 2 €/MWh RANGE. MISSING MONEY ISSUES
LIKELY TO ARISE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE 2020s AND TO BE AMPLIFIED IN
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS**

#### 24-25 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Increase competition for the existing fleet brought by the expected
energy outlook characterized by subdued electricity demand, greater
share of RES and import in the energy mix affecting CSS for existing
CCGTs, averaging -1.5 €/MWh between 2024-2025.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Market competition is expected to increase with the stable import flows
from the northern borders, the rise in renewable capacity, and the entry
of new high-efficiency CCGTs, which were acquired through Capacity
Market auctions. These factors will keep the baseload CSS in negative
territory. In the Low scenario, where renewable development is greater
and the competition within the thermoelectric sector is stronger, this
effect will be even more pronounced.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 31-50 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
After 2030, a significant decrease in net import flows and the exit of
some ageing capacity allow existing CCGTs (53%-efficiency) to remain the
marginal technology in the system for at least 85% of the hours, with
the baseload CSS around -1 €/MWh. Greater renewable penetration in the
Low scenario, maintain the baseload CSS below 4 €/MWh also in the
long-term. In the High scenario reduce renewable development favor CCGT
production increasing the baseload CSS.

### Day-Ahead Market Profitability for CCGT Units

#### 24-25 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Captured CSS evolve depending on the zone mix, with southern bidding
zones suffering the high operativity of coal-fired units and significant
risk of operation at loss, while CCGT producing in the northern zone
manage to guarantee positive margins at around 15 €/MWh , favored by the
current market dynamics.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
As renewable capacity increases, existing units tend to concentrate
their operations during evening hours to maximize captured margins. The
high-efficiency gas-fired capacity captured CSS is subject to
competitive market conditions as new projects enter the market with
support from the latest CM auction. Despite this, the high efficiency of
these projects enables them to maintain an average captured margin of 15
€/MWh.
:::
:::

#### 31-50 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Growing renewable penetration intensifies overgeneration phenomena and
accentuates evening price spikes, determining an increasing trend for
captured marginality for existing units in the first half of the 2030s,
but load factors reduce progressively on increasing renewables share and
increase competition from high efficiency units.

Increasing pace of installations and the consequent cannibalization and
overgeneration effects -- only partially limited by power intensive
storages and grid developments -- have an impact on zonal captured
prices, which trend diverges compared to baseload prices.
:::

::: callout-left
#### 31-50 {.unnumbered}

The increasing occurrence of overgeneration serves as a market signal
for the entry of energy-intensive storages, which partially mitigate the
cannibalization phenomenon. After 2030, the cannibalization effect
becomes more noticeable in the captured prices of solar energy,
parcularly in southern market zones with higher renewable penetration.

production has a major impact in the early 2030s, but the results of
both sources remain more connected to zonal market dynamics than to the

Procured ex-ante ancillary services volumes are expected to partially
recover from 2022, but remaining lower compared to the past as a
consequence of (i) greater availability of thermoelectric running
reserve due to reversed switching conditions, (ii) changes in the
network management approach adopted by Terna since the beginning of the
cost-containment incentive scheme (2022), (iii) feasibility intervals
imposed to power plants in the new Intra-Day Market structure.

The exit of coal-fired units on the mainland and the progressive
increase in the energy mix of renewable production are compensated by
the entry of (i) new thermoelectric and energy intensive storage
capacity sustained by the Capacity Market mechanism, and (ii) the
diffusion of power intensive BESS that are going to reduce the need of
ex ante scheduling, given the availability of flexible resources in the
system.

ASM ex-ante volumes are expected to contract and then remain stable
during the 2030s as consequence of a more efficient purchase, thanks to
flexible resources and grid reinforcement. On the other side an increase
of MB can be expected in line with the increasing volatility driven by
the strong development of RES in the scenario, sustaining units
operativity.

Procured ex-ante ancillary services volumes are expected to remain low
compared to the recent past also in the alternative scenarios, with some
differences determined by the different degree of competition in the
thermoelectric sector on the DAM -- that translates into different
levels of running reserve.
:::
:::

::: callout-item

#### 26-31 {.unnumbered}
:::

Rapid growth of non-programmable renewable generation in the Low
scenario is counterbalanced by grid developments and a faster
development of energy intensive storages. In the High scenario the
development of less flexible resources increases the need to purchase
more volumes on MSD.
:::
:::

::: callout-item

#### 31-50 {.unnumbered}
:::

In the Low scenario, further grid development and a major development of
energy intensive storage assets help containing ASM volumes. In the High
scenario instead ASM volumes remains stable, because of an increased
presence of CCGT on the DAM and the of still active coal plants untill
2025, furthermore development of energy intensive storage allows to beer
regulate the system.

During the first years of delivery of the Capacity Market, the strike
price is expected to have a cap effect on prices for start-up and upward
regulation, especially in the Centre-South market zone. However, the

Price competition on the ASM is expected to grow progressively as
innovative technological solutions will be gradually available in the
system at an increasingly competitive price (e.g., electrochemical
storages). Under the hypothesis of an extension of the capacity
remuneration mechanism, the strike price, together with the LCOS of
batteries, could become the main factors influencing ancillary services
prices in the future.
