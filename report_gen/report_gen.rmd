# Frame of Reference

REF-E scenarios over the time horizon 2024-2050 (with projections up to
2060) are elaborated by MBS Consulting experts on the base of
proprietary suites and market knowledge. Econometric and structural
models, as well as our expert sensitiveness, detailed knowledge of
regulation, and accurate monitoring of market outcomes underlie our
elaborations.

Gas and electricity forecasts consider the diverse geopolitical and
economic hypothesis deriving from the regulatory, financial and
fundamentals adjustments to the disruption generated both from the
pandemic and the Ukrainian war, which are seen as key determinants of
the future equilibrium of the energy markets.

Current scenario update incorporates an evolution of climate variables
in line with the historical average trend. In this perspective, we
defined three scenarios:

-   The **High Case scenario** is characterized by permanently high
    prices amid import-export tensions, supply scarcity and possible
    logistic locks. Negative or zero economic growth and the energy
    transition process failure would follow because of investments
    disruption.

-   In the **Reference scenario**, prices remain high in the short-term
    since still low supplies combines with demand growth. However, the
    energy transition process continues leading to a progressive
    diversification of energy sources. This, combined with efficiency
    and high prices induced savings leads the energy market towards a
    normalization path. The economic growth suffers a contraction over
    the next two years, followed by recovery.

-   The **Low Case scenario** would materialize in the event of
    favourable weather conditions and a fast energy transition,
    supported by low inflation and a faster economic recovery, reducing
    demand over the next few years.

This would limit prices upside potential and then fuel a downward
acceleration.

## Scenario highlights

**Short-term perspectives for Italy have relaxed compared to the recent
past, although tensions on energy markets are still possible given the
fragile equilibrium on gas market: intensified competitive dynamics
between Europe and Asia could drive prices up on the electricity market
as well.**

Relaxation in market fundamentals, a significant slowdown in economic
growth and still subdued power demand are the key determinant for the
electricity prices easing expected for the 2024-2025 period. Ongoing
consumption trends appear to confirm a positive impact of the energy
crisis on the acceleration of energy-saving investments and more
flexible behaviours on the energy demand side. Whether the overall
decrease in power demand dealt with short-term electricity savings or
structural efficiency measures is still under observation, but effects
are accounted for in near-term demand projections.

Contraction in electricity demand (-10 TWh y/y), recovery in hydro
generation after the severe drought during the first months of 2023, an
higher than historical level installation rate in renewable guarantied
an increase in RES quota (30% of demand, +22% y/y) in the energy mix
affecting the competitiveness for gas generation units. Furthermore,
electricity demand contraction also in the other European countries,
rebound in hydro generation together with an improved availability of
French nuclear fleet increase the potential export flows from
interconnected countries, resulting in an increased net import from the
northern border (+10 TWh y/y). In the coming years the expectation of a
slow recovery in electricity demand, below 2019 level until 2026, and a
sustained pace of renewable installations (+3.5 GW per year in Reference
scenario and +6 GW in the Low scenario) may intensify market competition
for gas-fired power plants.

**In 2023, a notable increase in renewable installation rate (+5.7 GW
compared to 1.5 GW/y during the last 5 years), driven by solar
technologies, marks a further step towards the net zero path in the long
run, despite a still uncertain economy recovery; permitting process
simplifications, attractive market signals and investment costs
reduction, driven by supply chain recovery may further accentuate the
trend.**

The Italian 2024 GDP growth is expected to remain almost close to zero
in the Reference scenario, since inflation and restrictive monetary
policies weigh on economic growth, while a recovery of demand and
investments should sustain GDP growth in 2025 and for all the scenario
years. In the High case the pessimistic macroeconomic view ( -0.5% y/y)
for the GDP in 2024 and the overall deceleration in growth in the
ensuing years, undermines the system’s potential.

The inflation trajectory will play a crucial role in defining the
economic outlook performance. Private consumptions and industry
investments persist in subdued, curbing growth projections in the short
term. However, a possible faster normalization in inflation may
speeds-up monetary policy normalization, supporting investments leading
to our LOW Case scenario, with the GDP growth moving back to just below
1% (y/y) already in 2024.

Continuous relaxation in gas market dynamics over 2023 have favoured the
easing in global prices. Favourable weather conditions, with subdued
demand, abundant storage facilities, and stable supplies have guaranteed
market stability in the short-term. The European market equilibrium
remains delicate though, depending on LNG imports, strongly affected by
competition with Northeast Asia. A faster recovery in Chinese industrial
and transport sector pushed LNG demand in 2023, +10% y/y. Additionally,
intensified competition driven by pricesensitive buyers in Asia could
amplify market volatility, influencing price trends until 2025. By then,
the availability of new liquefaction capacity should expand the global
LNG demand-supply margin, mitigating potential tightness risks.

The gas price forecasts were revised in the short-term following the
relaxation in market fundamentals and the significant slowdown in
economic growth in Europe. TTF and PSV yearly price projections in the
REFERENCE scenario average around 50 €/MWh for 2024 and decline towards
35 €/MWh in 2025 when liquefaction and regasification capacity should
rebalance the supply-demand dynamics. If the global economic recovery
stall and no competition arise on gas supplies, the gas prices decline
may continue, with the PSV averaging below 30 €/MWh in 2024 as in the
Low case, while in the High scenario an escalation of geopolitical
tensions and increased competition on LNG supplies may emphasize the
market upward potential with the yearly PSV averaging 80 €/MWh.

In 2024, the average CO2 price is should to approach €90/ton, driven by
the gradual implementation of reforms within the ETS system, supporting
the CO2 prices. The gradual integration of the maritime transport sector
into the ETS scheme, as outlined in EU Directive 2023/959, is expected
to unfold incrementally, potentially lacking a substantial impact on
allowances demand in the short run. However, a notable divergence
between supply and demand is projected to emerge around 2027 as the
maritime sector fully integrates into the ETS system, leading to a tight
market, with CO2 prices forecasted to surge towards an average of
€110/ton by 2030. In 2023 electricity consumption curbs to 306 TWh but
it is expected to eventually resume in 2024 reaching 311 TWh driven by
recover in consumption and electrification. A moderate economic growth,
driven by supportive measures, and quicker, but yet limited
electrification allows the demand to reach 340 TWh in 2030. Acceleration
of end-use electrification and full unfolding of efficiency potential
driven by a more positive economic outlook in the LOW Case scenario
should overcome the 2023 drop, and reach 313 TWh in 2024 (still below
2022 result) and head to the 360 TWh in 2030. On the contrary, in the
HIGH case scenario, halted efficiency investments and slow economy
recovery should keep power demand below 2022 level during 2024-2025
period, potentially growing up to 328 TWh in 2030.

The enhanced availability of France's nuclear fleet, coupled with a full
recovery in hydroelectric generation across Europe, should ensure a
stable energy net import flow of around 40 TWh towards Italy. In
perspective, the gradual phase-out of coal-fired and nuclear capacity in
the continental Europe could drive the sharp reduction of imported
energy in the post-2030 horizon1. French nuclear fleet availability
remains a central variable for the power exchange dynamics in Italy and
phase-out decisions should drive the potential decline of net import
form Northern borders after 2030 if not replaced by investments in new
nuclear generation capacity.

Renewables gain share rapidly as the 2023 momentum is expected to
enhance over the coming years, with a yearly increase up to 6 GW (4.5 GW
of solar and 1.5 GW of wind) in the Low scenario and 3 GW (2 GW of solar
and 1 GW of wind) in the Reference case, still below the NIECP average
annual target of 8 GW necessary to reach the 2030 targets. Improved
regulation, decreasing investment costs and ETS price signals should
support the market parity conditions in the long run. The share of
demand covered by renewables in 2030 reach almost 50 % and 60% mark in
the REFERENCE and the LOW case respectively, while remains close to 40%
in the HIGH case. Zonal distribution of the new capacity additions
follows the patterns revealed by Terna’s connection request database,
and new utility scale projects are expected to concentrate mostly in the
Southern macrozone and the two islands. Growth of small-scale
distributed renewables for self-consumption is more concentrated in the
Norther area following the historical path with 6% annual increase. Grid
expansion reflect Terna’s 2023 Development Plan indications. In the
REFERENCE case reinforcements are assumed operational already in the
2020s but the main improvements to resolve zonal congestions are
expected to be completed in the 2030s – Tyrrhenian link and Adriatic
link as well as first portions of the Hypergrid. Faster penetration of
renewable energy in the LOW case would require the realization of the
main projects even before 2030, while the slower system transition in
the HIGH case postpone the key investments to the middle of the 2030s.

The need to boost energy independence in the decarbonization process at
European level has already put hydrogen at the central stage of the
future European energy strategy (REPowerEU) and could result in the
allocation of significant financings – way more than the amount
currently earmarked – to accelerate the development of a European
hydrogen supply chain, improving current cost perspectives of green
solutions. But accelerating renewables development materializes the risk
of structural overgeneration if the development of BESS does not
progress concurrently, especially in areas that are less interconnected
with the rest of the system and have a high intensity of renewables
relative to demand, such as Sardinia and La Sicilia in Sardinia and
Sicily where economically viable opportunities for competitive green
hydrogen consolidate starting from 2035.

By 2030, significant overgeneration and curtailment risks are expected
to arise in the Southern zone and the Islands, which will prompt a surge
in new electrochemical storage projects. Depending on the alternative
scenarios of RES and grid development trajectories, these dynamics may
be accelerated or delayed. Long-term development of batteries should
follow the opportunities for time-shifting applications on the day-ahead
market.

Investments in power intensive electrochemical batteries can be
in-the-money in the medium-term, with revenue streams deriving mainly
from the participation in the balancing phase of the Ancillary Services
Market and a long-term capacity remuneration through specific projects.
Investments in merchant energy intensive storage batteries are likely to
be attractive only in the long-term when time-shifting applications on
the DAM could become economically sustainable thanks to increasing price
spread volatility and the presence of overgeneration. In 2040, up to 22
GW of energy intensive batteries are expected to be developed in our
REFERENCE scenario.

In the REFERENCE scenario gas-fired generation is expected to remain at
the backbone of the national energy mix even after renewables become the
first production source through the next decades, until 2031 when RES
become the main resource in the mix. Its share in the generation mix
should decrease progressively but stay close to 30% of the national
electricity needs until 2040.\
However, mutated market conditions, triggered by the geopolitical
tensions and contingent factors witnessed during the last year and a
half, combined with implications of market design and regulation
evolution (XBID, Terna’s Incentive scheme, TIDE reform) unveil a changed
market landscape context that is expected to permanently change the
structure of revenue flows for gas-fired power plants.

Presence of coal units in the generation mix combined with the power
demand slowdown are expected to partially limit the day-ahead market
operativity of gas power plants and to reduce their margins in the
20242025 period, further worsened by the structural and permanent
reduction in ASM volumes. In the longer run, after 2026, despite the
entrance of less new generation CCGTs through the capacity market,
competition for existing units should increase, further exacerbated by
continuous acceleration in renewables development, but to be also
partially compensated by coal phase-out of generation units in the
Italian peninsula2 and by import reduction after 2030. The clean spark
spread, which is strictly related to the evolution of existing CCGTs
market share that remain the technology fixing the prices in most hours,
remains negative on baseload basis, but the flexible operation of gas
fired assets allows to optimise the actual captured value. Even though
volatility and competitiveness increase, the day-ahead market remains
the primary source of revenues for CCGTs. Missing money issues could
arise for part of the existing CCGT fleet and the extension of a
Capacity Remuneration Mechanism only for existing capacity could
mitigate the risk of a non-adequate system.

Market prices in the short-term will mainly be guided by commodities
prices dynamics. A gradual normalization of gas prices can be reflected
in the power prices in the mid-term. In the long-term, power prices will
be mainly driven by CO2 movements, while the impact of other commodities
are expected to reach a stable equilibrium. Renewables penetration,
mainly led by solar energy, is expected to strongly affect peak/off-peak
dynamics after 2030, when the inversion of price spreads between time
slots is expected to occur. Zonal spreads reflect the disruptive
variations of the generation mix and grid in the three alternative
views. In the short term, the REFERENCE case predicts that zonal prices
will diverge due to the cost-effectiveness of coal production in
specific areas. However, over the long term, the significant development
of renewable energy sources in the southern macro-zone is expected to
drive prices down through the cannibalization of solar technologies.
Despite anticipated grid improvements, bottlenecks are still expected
between the northern and southern zones, resulting in differing price
levels in the 2030s. From 2035 onwards, further grid reinforcements are
assumed to occur, resulting in a reduction of inter-zonal congestion
issues on the mainland. However, criticalities are likely to remain
evident in the islands.

Systematic and significant contraction of volumes exchanged on the
ancillary services market has been observed since mid-2021 for both
upward and downward operations. At the basis of the new trend there are
multiple drivers that are expected to change the role and the
perspective of the ancillary services market. The origin of the new
trends is actually a combination of factors with less or more contingent
nature such as: available running reserve due to reversed switching
conditions, evidence for changes in the network management criteria
adopted by Terna potentially connected to the incentives for ASM cost
reduction, feasibility intervals imposed to power plants in the new
Intra-Day Market continuous structure. The traditional market phase for
regulation services is expected to become riskier and tighter, and to
offer only a marginal integration to the spot market profits. Limited
room is expected to remain a permanent trend in the long run, further
supported by the commissioning of additional flexible thermal and
storage capacity. Delay of grid investments with respect to the
renewable growth could impact on the security condition with a wide
heterogeneity at nodal level: local criticalities and limited renewable
hosting capacity could be mitigated by storage waiting for structural
network reinforcements.

The new long-term scenario analysis of MBS takes into consideration the
latest trends of the Italian system evolution, it peers itself with the
Fit-for-55 targets in 2030 and discusses the possible paths towards
2050. Market simulations are extended beyond 2040 by explicitly
modelling the market fundamentals through deterministic techniques and
by assuming an inertial evolution, in line with the average 2030 – 2040
trajectory, for renewables installation sustained by BESS technologies,
reduction in gas generation quota in the energy mix, electrification of
consumptions and a proportional gird development on top of Terna
development plan. All the elaborations are done considering the market
structure and rules as known of today.

The resulting trajectory lacks behind the Net Zero targets: by 2050,
only 85% of Italian electricity demand is expected to be met by
renewable generation, while the residual demand would be covered by
flexible and efficient gas generation, still needed by the system for
adequacy reasons. Further contraction in operating hours (morning and
evening peaks) impose the need of an explicit remuneration mechanism to
support their economic viability. Renewables are expected to become the
predominant marginal technology and market prices are expected to become
less dependent on gas generation costs and more related to LCOE of
renewable technologies as their marginal quota reach 40% of the yearly
hours.

For evaluating price dynamics beyond 2050 (2050-2060 horizon),we assume
an extension of 2050 results taking into account the uncertainty of
available information for an explicit evaluation of the very long-term.
2040 -2060 scenarios will be carefully evaluated in future updates in
order to discuss the economic sustainability of policy scenarios
implementing the net zero target.

In the High scenario, net imports remain sustained as switching condions only parally improve and no significant nuclear/coal-fired dismission is supposed in connental Europe.

Procured ex-ante ancillary services volumes are expected to parally recover from 2022, but remaining lower compared to the past as a consequence of (i) greater availability of thermoelectric running reserve due to reversed switching condions, (ii) changes in the network management approach adopted by Terna since the beginning of the cost-containment incenve scheme (2022), (iii) feasibility intervals imposed to power plants in the new Intra-Day Market structure.

The exit of coal-fired units on the mainland and the progressive increase in the energy mix of renewable producon are compensated by the entry of (i) new thermoelectric and energy intensive storage capacity sustained by the Capacity Market mechanism, and (ii) the diffusion of power intensive BESS that are going to reduce the need of ex ante scheduling, given the availability of flexible resources in the system.

ASM ex-ante volumes are expected to contract and then remain stable during the 2030s as consequence of a more efficient purchase, thanks to flexible resources and grid reinforcement. On the other side an increase of MB can be expected in line with the increasing volality driven by the strong development of RES in the scenario, sustaining units operavity.

** ANCILLARY SERVICES EX-ANTE VOLUMES EVOLVE ACCORDING TO THE COMPOSITION OF THE GENERATION MIX AND DAM DYNAMICS IN THE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS. IN THE POST-2030 SCENARIO, STORAGE SYSTEMS AND GRID REINFORCEMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO LIMIT THE EXPANSION TREND IN THE THREE SCENARIOS **

Procured ex-ante ancillary services volumes are expected to remain low compared to the recent past also in the alternave scenarios, with some differences determined by the different degree of compeon in the thermoelectric sector on the DAM – that translates into different levels of running reserve.

Rapid growth of non-programmable renewable generaon in the Low scenario is counterbalanced by grid developments and a faster development of energy intensive storages. In the High scenario the development of less flexible resources increases the need to purchase more volumes on MSD.

In the Low scenario, further grid development and a major development of energy intensive storage assets help containing ASM volumes. In the High scenario instead ASM volumes remains stable, because of an increased presence of CCGT on the DAM and the of sll acve coal plants unll 2025, furthermore development of energy intensive storage allows to beer regulate the system.

** GRID BOTTLENECKS RESOLUTION AND BESS PENETRATION ARE AMONG THE MAIN DRIVERS OF THE FUTURE ASM COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS. THE CAPACITY MARKET STRIKE PRICE (IN DELIVERY YEARS) COULD BECOME THE
REFERENCE UPWARD PRICE, WITH MAJOR IMPACTS IN THE CENTRE-SOUTH MARKET ZONE **

During the first years of delivery of the Capacity Market, the strike price is expected to have a cap effect on prices for start-up and upward regulaon, especially in the Centre-South market zone. However, the recent downward trend of ASM volumes could foster price compeon all over Italy compared to past years.

Price compeon on the ASM is expected to grow progressively as innovave technological soluons will be gradually available in the system at an increasingly compeve price (e.g., electrochemical storages). Under the hypothesis of an extension of the capacity remuneraon mechanism, the strike price, together with the LCOS of baeries, could become the main factors influencing ancillary services prices in the future.

Price projecons are based on a stascal approach describing the historical bidding strategies of market players on the ASM. Historical distribuons of price spreads between DAM and ASM prices for each type of service are assumed constant in the future. Compared to the previous release, the new ASM price projecons incorporate the effects of updated hypothesis determining DAM dynamics and prices.
