# Frame of Reference

REF-E scenarios over the time horizon 2024-2050 (with projections up to
2060) are elaborated by MBS Consulting experts on the base of
proprietary suites and market knowledge. Econometric and structural
models, as well as our expert sensitiveness, detailed knowledge of
regulation, and accurate monitoring of market outcomes underlie our
elaborations.

Gas and electricity forecasts consider the diverse geopolitical and
economic hypothesis deriving from the regulatory, financial and
fundamentals adjustments to the disruption generated both from the
pandemic and the Ukrainian war, which are seen as key determinants of
the future equilibrium of the energy markets.

Current scenario update incorporates an evolution of climate variables
in line with the historical average trend. In this perspective, we
defined three scenarios:

-   The **High Case scenario** is characterized by permanently high
    prices amid import-export tensions, supply scarcity and possible
    logistic locks. Negative or zero economic growth and the energy
    transition process failure would follow because of investments
    disruption.

-   In the **Reference scenario**, prices remain high in the short-term
    since still low supplies combines with demand growth. However, the
    energy transition process continues leading to a progressive
    diversification of energy sources. This, combined with efficiency
    and high prices induced savings leads the energy market towards a
    normalization path. The economic growth suffers a contraction over
    the next two years, followed by recovery.

-   The **Low Case scenario** would materialize in the event of
    favourable weather conditions and a fast energy transition,
    supported by low inflation and a faster economic recovery, reducing
    demand over the next few years.

This would limit prices upside potential and then fuel a downward
acceleration.

## Scenario highlights

**Short-term perspectives for Italy have relaxed compared to the recent
past, although tensions on energy markets are still possible given the
fragile equilibrium on gas market: intensified competitive dynamics
between Europe and Asia could drive prices up on the electricity market
as well.**

Relaxation in market fundamentals, a significant slowdown in economic
growth and still subdued power demand are the key determinant for the
electricity prices easing expected for the 2024-2025 period. Ongoing
consumption trends appear to confirm a positive impact of the energy
crisis on the acceleration of energy-saving investments and more
flexible behaviours on the energy demand side. Whether the overall
decrease in power demand dealt with short-term electricity savings or
structural efficiency measures is still under observation, but effects
are accounted for in near-term demand projections.

Contraction in electricity demand (-10 TWh y/y), recovery in hydro
generation after the severe drought during the first months of 2023, an
higher than historical level installation rate in renewable guarantied
an increase in RES quota (30% of demand, +22% y/y) in the energy mix
affecting the competitiveness for gas generation units. Furthermore,
electricity demand contraction also in the other European countries,
rebound in hydro generation together with an improved availability of
French nuclear fleet increase the potential export flows from
interconnected countries, resulting in an increased net import from the
northern border (+10 TWh y/y). In the coming years the expectation of a
slow recovery in electricity demand, below 2019 level until 2026, and a
sustained pace of renewable installations (+3.5 GW per year in Reference
scenario and +6 GW in the Low scenario) may intensify market competition
for gas-fired power plants.

**In 2023, a notable increase in renewable installation rate (+5.7 GW
compared to 1.5 GW/y during the last 5 years), driven by solar
technologies, marks a further step towards the net zero path in the long
run, despite a still uncertain economy recovery; permitting process
simplifications, attractive market signals and investment costs
reduction, driven by supply chain recovery may further accentuate the
trend.**

The Italian 2024 GDP growth is expected to remain almost close to zero
in the Reference scenario, since inflation and restrictive monetary
policies weigh on economic growth, while a recovery of demand and
investments should sustain GDP growth in 2025 and for all the scenario
years. In the High case the pessimistic macroeconomic view ( -0.5% y/y)
for the GDP in 2024 and the overall deceleration in growth in the
ensuing years, undermines the system's potential.

The inflation trajectory will play a crucial role in defining the
economic outlook performance. Private consumptions and industry
investments persist in subdued, curbing growth projections in the short
term. However, a possible faster normalization in inflation may
speeds-up monetary policy normalization, supporting investments leading
to our LOW Case scenario, with the GDP growth moving back to just below
1% (y/y) already in 2024.

Continuous relaxation in gas market dynamics over 2023 have favoured the
easing in global prices. Favourable weather conditions, with subdued
demand, abundant storage facilities, and stable supplies have guaranteed
market stability in the short-term. The European market equilibrium
remains delicate though, depending on LNG imports, strongly affected by
competition with Northeast Asia. A faster recovery in Chinese industrial
and transport sector pushed LNG demand in 2023, +10% y/y. Additionally,
intensified competition driven by pricesensitive buyers in Asia could
amplify market volatility, influencing price trends until 2025. By then,
the availability of new liquefaction capacity should expand the global
LNG demand-supply margin, mitigating potential tightness risks.

The gas price forecasts were revised in the short-term following the
relaxation in market fundamentals and the significant slowdown in
economic growth in Europe. TTF and PSV yearly price projections in the
REFERENCE scenario average around 50 €/MWh for 2024 and decline towards
35 €/MWh in 2025 when liquefaction and regasification capacity should
rebalance the supply-demand dynamics. If the global economic recovery
stall and no competition arise on gas supplies, the gas prices decline
may continue, with the PSV averaging below 30 €/MWh in 2024 as in the
Low case, while in the High scenario an escalation of geopolitical
tensions and increased competition on LNG supplies may emphasize the
market upward potential with the yearly PSV averaging 80 €/MWh.

In 2024, the average CO2 price is should to approach €90/ton, driven by
the gradual implementation of reforms within the ETS system, supporting
the CO2 prices. The gradual integration of the maritime transport sector
into the ETS scheme, as outlined in EU Directive 2023/959, is expected
to unfold incrementally, potentially lacking a substantial impact on
allowances demand in the short run. However, a notable divergence
between supply and demand is projected to emerge around 2027 as the
maritime sector fully integrates into the ETS system, leading to a tight
market, with CO2 prices forecasted to surge towards an average of
€110/ton by 2030. In 2023 electricity consumption curbs to 306 TWh but
it is expected to eventually resume in 2024 reaching 311 TWh driven by
recover in consumption and electrification. A moderate economic growth,
driven by supportive measures, and quicker, but yet limited
electrification allows the demand to reach 340 TWh in 2030. Acceleration
of end-use electrification and full unfolding of efficiency potential
driven by a more positive economic outlook in the LOW Case scenario
should overcome the 2023 drop, and reach 313 TWh in 2024 (still below
2022 result) and head to the 360 TWh in 2030. On the contrary, in the
HIGH case scenario, halted efficiency investments and slow economy
recovery should keep power demand below 2022 level during 2024-2025
period, potentially growing up to 328 TWh in 2030.

The enhanced availability of France's nuclear fleet, coupled with a full
recovery in hydroelectric generation across Europe, should ensure a
stable energy net import flow of around 40 TWh towards Italy. In
perspective, the gradual phase-out of coal-fired and nuclear capacity in
the continental Europe could drive the sharp reduction of imported
energy in the post-2030 horizon1. French nuclear fleet availability
remains a central variable for the power exchange dynamics in Italy and
phase-out decisions should drive the potential decline of net import
form Northern borders after 2030 if not replaced by investments in new
nuclear generation capacity.

Renewables gain share rapidly as the 2023 momentum is expected to
enhance over the coming years, with a yearly increase up to 6 GW (4.5 GW
of solar and 1.5 GW of wind) in the Low scenario and 3 GW (2 GW of solar
and 1 GW of wind) in the Reference case, still below the NIECP average
annual target of 8 GW necessary to reach the 2030 targets. Improved
regulation, decreasing investment costs and ETS price signals should
support the market parity conditions in the long run. The share of
demand covered by renewables in 2030 reach almost 50 % and 60% mark in
the REFERENCE and the LOW case respectively, while remains close to 40%
in the HIGH case. Zonal distribution of the new capacity additions
follows the patterns revealed by Terna's connection request database,
and new utility scale projects are expected to concentrate mostly in the
Southern macrozone and the two islands. Growth of small-scale
distributed renewables for self-consumption is more concentrated in the
Norther area following the historical path with 6% annual increase. Grid
expansion reflect Terna's 2023 Development Plan indications. In the
REFERENCE case reinforcements are assumed operational already in the
2020s but the main improvements to resolve zonal congestions are
expected to be completed in the 2030s -- Tyrrhenian link and Adriatic
link as well as first portions of the Hypergrid. Faster penetration of
renewable energy in the LOW case would require the realization of the
main projects even before 2030, while the slower system transition in
the HIGH case postpone the key investments to the middle of the 2030s.

The need to boost energy independence in the decarbonization process at
European level has already put hydrogen at the central stage of the
future European energy strategy (REPowerEU) and could result in the
allocation of significant financings -- way more than the amount
currently earmarked -- to accelerate the development of a European
hydrogen supply chain, improving current cost perspectives of green
solutions. But accelerating renewables development materializes the risk
of structural overgeneration if the development of BESS does not
progress concurrently, especially in areas that are less interconnected
with the rest of the system and have a high intensity of renewables
relative to demand, such as Sardinia and La Sicilia in Sardinia and
Sicily where economically viable opportunities for competitive green
hydrogen consolidate starting from 2035.

By 2030, significant overgeneration and curtailment risks are expected
to arise in the Southern zone and the Islands, which will prompt a surge
in new electrochemical storage projects. Depending on the alternative
scenarios of RES and grid development trajectories, these dynamics may
be accelerated or delayed. Long-term development of batteries should
follow the opportunities for time-shifting applications on the day-ahead
market.

Investments in power intensive electrochemical batteries can be
in-the-money in the medium-term, with revenue streams deriving mainly
from the participation in the balancing phase of the Ancillary Services
Market and a long-term capacity remuneration through specific projects.
Investments in merchant energy intensive storage batteries are likely to
be attractive only in the long-term when time-shifting applications on
the DAM could become economically sustainable thanks to increasing price
spread volatility and the presence of overgeneration. In 2040, up to 22
GW of energy intensive batteries are expected to be developed in our
REFERENCE scenario.

In the REFERENCE scenario gas-fired generation is expected to remain at
the backbone of the national energy mix even after renewables become the
first production source through the next decades, until 2031 when RES
become the main resource in the mix. Its share in the generation mix
should decrease progressively but stay close to 30% of the national
electricity needs until 2040.\
However, mutated market conditions, triggered by the geopolitical
tensions and contingent factors witnessed during the last year and a
half, combined with implications of market design and regulation
evolution (XBID, Terna's Incentive scheme, TIDE reform) unveil a changed
market landscape context that is expected to permanently change the
structure of revenue flows for gas-fired power plants.

Presence of coal units in the generation mix combined with the power
demand slowdown are expected to partially limit the day-ahead market
operativity of gas power plants and to reduce their margins in the
20242025 period, further worsened by the structural and permanent
reduction in ASM volumes. In the longer run, after 2026, despite the
entrance of less new generation CCGTs through the capacity market,
competition for existing units should increase, further exacerbated by
continuous acceleration in renewables development, but to be also
partially compensated by coal phase-out of generation units in the
Italian peninsula2 and by import reduction after 2030. The clean spark
spread, which is strictly related to the evolution of existing CCGTs
market share that remain the technology fixing the prices in most hours,
remains negative on baseload basis, but the flexible operation of gas
fired assets allows to optimise the actual captured value. Even though
volatility and competitiveness increase, the day-ahead market remains
the primary source of revenues for CCGTs. Missing money issues could
arise for part of the existing CCGT fleet and the extension of a
Capacity Remuneration Mechanism only for existing capacity could
mitigate the risk of a non-adequate system.

Market prices in the short-term will mainly be guided by commodities
prices dynamics. A gradual normalization of gas prices can be reflected
in the power prices in the mid-term. In the long-term, power prices will
be mainly driven by CO2 movements, while the impact of other commodities
are expected to reach a stable equilibrium. Renewables penetration,
mainly led by solar energy, is expected to strongly affect peak/off-peak
dynamics after 2030, when the inversion of price spreads between time
slots is expected to occur. Zonal spreads reflect the disruptive
variations of the generation mix and grid in the three alternative
views. In the short term, the REFERENCE case predicts that zonal prices
will diverge due to the cost-effectiveness of coal production in
specific areas. However, over the long term, the significant development
of renewable energy sources in the southern macro-zone is expected to
drive prices down through the cannibalization of solar technologies.
Despite anticipated grid improvements, bottlenecks are still expected
between the northern and southern zones, resulting in differing price
levels in the 2030s. From 2035 onwards, further grid reinforcements are
assumed to occur, resulting in a reduction of inter-zonal congestion
issues on the mainland. However, criticalities are likely to remain
evident in the islands.

Systematic and significant contraction of volumes exchanged on the
ancillary services market has been observed since mid-2021 for both
upward and downward operations. At the basis of the new trend there are
multiple drivers that are expected to change the role and the
perspective of the ancillary services market. The origin of the new
trends is actually a combination of factors with less or more contingent
nature such as: available running reserve due to reversed switching
conditions, evidence for changes in the network management criteria
adopted by Terna potentially connected to the incentives for ASM cost
reduction, feasibility intervals imposed to power plants in the new
Intra-Day Market continuous structure. The traditional market phase for
regulation services is expected to become riskier and tighter, and to
offer only a marginal integration to the spot market profits. Limited
room is expected to remain a permanent trend in the long run, further
supported by the commissioning of additional flexible thermal and
storage capacity. Delay of grid investments with respect to the
renewable growth could impact on the security condition with a wide
heterogeneity at nodal level: local criticalities and limited renewable
hosting capacity could be mitigated by storage waiting for structural
network reinforcements.

The new long-term scenario analysis of MBS takes into consideration the
latest trends of the Italian system evolution, it peers itself with the
Fit-for-55 targets in 2030 and discusses the possible paths towards
2050. Market simulations are extended beyond 2040 by explicitly
modelling the market fundamentals through deterministic techniques and
by assuming an inertial evolution, in line with the average 2030 -- 2040
trajectory, for renewables installation sustained by BESS technologies,
reduction in gas generation quota in the energy mix, electrification of
consumptions and a proportional gird development on top of Terna
development plan. All the elaborations are done considering the market
structure and rules as known of today.

The resulting trajectory lacks behind the Net Zero targets: by 2050,
only 85% of Italian electricity demand is expected to be met by
renewable generation, while the residual demand would be covered by
flexible and efficient gas generation, still needed by the system for
adequacy reasons. Further contraction in operating hours (morning and
evening peaks) impose the need of an explicit remuneration mechanism to
support their economic viability. Renewables are expected to become the
predominant marginal technology and market prices are expected to become
less dependent on gas generation costs and more related to LCOE of
renewable technologies as their marginal quota reach 40% of the yearly
hours.

For evaluating price dynamics beyond 2050 (2050-2060 horizon),we assume
an extension of 2050 results taking into account the uncertainty of
available information for an explicit evaluation of the very long-term.
2040 -2060 scenarios will be carefully evaluated in future updates in
order to discuss the economic sustainability of policy scenarios
implementing the net zero target.

In 2023, global LNG demand increased by 2% year-on-year, and it's
predicted to rise by close to 5% annually in both 2024 and 2025, driven
by an increased demand from Europe and China. Despite limited global LNG
supply growth in 2024, competition between Europe and Asia will
decrease, and new capacity coming online in 2024 and 2025 should meet
demand. The balance of LNG demand between Europe and Asia, influenced by
economic activity and weather conditions, along with the progress of new
capacity, will be crucial in determining the global equilibrium in 2025
and 2026, with a growth rate potentially exceeding 7% in the high

The TTF 2023 average price settled just above 40 €/MWh, and based on our
reference scenario, expectations for the 2024 yearly average are
projected to establish close to 30 €/MWh. The persistence of subdued
demand, not anticipated to rebound in the short-term, driven by
structural changes in the energy markets and the recovery of RES
production, induce price expectations to remain low. Europe LNG import
capacity is poised to expand by further 30 Bcm in 2024, following the
delay of under construction regasification facilities to that year or
later. The development of European regasification capacity will
increasingly enable additional LNG arrivals, crucial to maintain market

of Russian piped gas.

Starting from 2025, there will be a gradual return to normalcy in the
global LNG market due to the deployment of new liquefaction capacity.
This normalization, combined with an accelerated energy transition, is
expected to lead to a steady decrease in European gas prices, reaching
around €30/MWh by 2028. The ongoing decarbonization process in Europe
will continue to reduce gas demand, which will further push prices down
towards the long-term equilibrium of €25/MWh. However, in a scenario of
persisting geopolitical and commercial tensions (High scenario), prices
may remain just below €45/MWh in the long term. Conversely, effective
green policies coupled with economic growth (Low scenario) could drive
prices significantly lower, with the TTF averaging around €10/MWh in the

The 2023 PSV average price settled just below 45 €/MWh in 2023. In 2024,
we anticipate a decrease in the PSV yearly average, with prices hovering
around 30 €/MWh. This downward revision in PSV forecasts for 2024-2026
can be attributed to constrained gas demand recovery, which, in turn,
stems from various factors. Firstly, gas consumption of the distribution
network is anticipated to remain subdued amid a shift towards savings
and efficiency. Limited growth in the energy-intensive sector and
lower-than-average thermoelectric gas demand driven by sustained
electricity imports and renewable electricity production on the rebound,
will further limit national gas consumption. Delays in the commissioning
of the Ravenna FSRU have also hampered gas demand recovery, falling
short of initial expectations.

In our Reference scenario, the 2024 CO2 price average is projected to
approach 65 €/ton, driven by the gradual implementation of the ETS
system reform supporting CO2 prices. The phasing out of free allowances
for the aviation sector, reaching 50% of the total in 2025, along with
the planned removal of 90 Mln permits from the market in 2024, are
expected to begin exerting upward pressure on allowances prices by
curtailing supply. From 2025 onwards, the progressive inclusion of the
maritime transport sector will further boost overall demand. Concerns
remain regarding effective demand recovery, which is anticipated to be
limited over the next couple of years due to anticipated slow economic
growth.

A notable widening of the supply-demand gap should manifest starting

The current zonal configuration derives from the base case proposed by
Terna in compliance with the CACM. Differences compared to the previous

#### 24-25 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
In 2024 and 2025, net import is going to increase, thanks to the
recovery of French nuclear power production after two years operation
and maintenance stops. The increase in hydro production in Switzerland
registered in the last years is also contributing to net import growth.
Net import is expected to reach 47.8 TWh in 2024, aligned with the value
registered in 2023 of 53 TWh and with the long-term reduction goal.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 26-30 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
Net imports flows are assumed to slowly decrease in the second half of
the decade to around 32 TWh in 2030. This is due to: (i) recovering
switching conditions and the partial dismission of the nuclear and coal-
fired capacity in France and Germany -- and considering also a BAU
approach in estimang the achievement of 2030 renewable targets in other
European countries; (ii) the go-live of the Tunisia-Sicily cable, that
reduces the net import balance by adding more than 3.5 TWh of export
flows .
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 31-50 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The phase-out of nuclear and coal-fired units in continental Europe
could lead to a further net import decrease in the 2030s, until 13 TWh
ca. in 2040. The slight increase in net import seen from 2035 is due to
an estimated reduction (1 TWh ca.) in the export flows towards Tunisia,
following the Tunisian system development plan. In the High scenario,
net imports remain sustained as switching conditions only partially
improve and no significant nuclear/coal-fired dismission is supposed in
continental Europe.

Net import is in line with the 2023 value of 53 TWh, considering the
reduction that is expected to happen in the next years thanks to

assumed equivalent to the Reference case under the assumption that
national grid security conditions must be ensured.

In order to effectively manage the growing penetration of renewable
energy sources and the associated overgeneration phenomena, the 2030s
will require significant investments in grid reinforcements and high-
capacity energy storage solutions. These measures will be crucial for
balancing the grid and ensuring stable energy supply, especially in
regions that are particularly prone to overgeneration. This excess
energy production could provide opportunities for the installation of
electrolysis capacity, which would not only help to take advantage of
excess energy production but also support ongoing investments in RES.

in the system, mainly in the islands. Grid investments and BESS are
going to be insufficient to mitigate the problem, creating favorable
conditions for green hydrogen, installed electrolysis capacity could
reach almost 0.5 GW in the Reference scenario, concetrated in Sardinia.
In the long-term, electrolysis capacity can effectively address
overgeneration by providing a means to store excess renewable energy.
Additionally, by increasing demand during periods of high RES
production, it can help sustain prices and mitigate the cannibalization
effect, particularly during the advanced transition phase.

high-efficiency gas-fired capacity captured CSS is subject to
competitive market conditions as new projects enter the market with
support from the latest CM auction. Despite this, the high efficiency of
these projects enables them to maintain an average captured margin above
15 €/MWh.

Growing renewable penetration intensifies overgeneration phenomena and
accentuates evening price spikes, determining an increasing trend for
captured marginality for existing units in the first half of the 2030s
but load factors reduce progressively on increasing renewables share and
increase competition from high efficiency units.

**PROGRESSIVELY INCREASING CANNIBALIZATION EFFECT IS EVIDENT ON SOLAR
PRICES FROM THE LATE 2020s, ESPECIALLY IN SOUTHERN MARKET ZONES, WHERE
RENEWABLE PENETRATION IS GREATER AND INTERCONNECTION CAPACITY WITH
NORTHERN ZONES IS LIMITED**

Increasing pace of installations and the consequent cannibalization and
overgeneration effects -- only partially limited by power intensive
storages and grid developments -- have an impact on zonal captured
prices, which trend diverges compared to baseload prices.

#### 31-50 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The increasing occurrence of overgeneration serves as a market signal
for the entry of energy-intensive storages, which partially mitigate the
cannibalization phenomenon. After 2030, the cannibalization effect
becomes more noticeable in the captured prices of solar energy,
parcularly in southern market zones with higher renewable penetration.

Captured prices remain basically in line zonal baseload prices also in
the long-term. The overgeneration induced by the growing solar
production has a major impact in the early 2030s, but the results of
both sources remain more connected to zonal market dynamics than to the
evolution of the price shape. Also, both sources benefit from a
production profile which is more distributed over the hours of the day
and over the year.

# Ancilliary Services & Fuels Mix

## Ancilliary Services Volumes, Reference Scenario

::: callout-main
**ANCILLARY SERVICES NEEDS ARE EXPECTED TO SHRINK IN THE FUTURE
FOLLOWING THE MOST RECENT PAST, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF PECULIAR MARKET
CONDITIONS AND CHANGES IN THE SYSTEM MANAGEMENT APPROACH ADOPTED BY THE
TSO. IN THE LONG-TERM BESS AND GRID DEVELOPMENT CAN IMRPOVE THE

:::

::: callout-right
Procured ex-ante ancillary services volumes are expected to partially
recover from 2022, but remaining lower compared to the past as a
consequence of (i) greater availability of thermoelectric running
reserve due to reversed switching conditions, (ii) changes in the
network management approach adopted by Terna since the beginning of the
cost-containment incentive scheme (2022), (iii) feasibility intervals
imposed to power plants in the new Intra-Day Market structure.

#### 26-31 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
The exit of coal-fired units on the mainland and the progressive
increase in the energy mix of renewable production are compensated by
the entry of (i) new thermoelectric and energy intensive storage
capacity sustained by the Capacity Market mechanism, and (ii) the
diffusion of power intensive BESS that are going to reduce the need of
ex ante scheduling, given the availability of flexible resources in the
system.

ASM ex-ante volumes are expected to contract and then remain stable
during the 2030s as consequence of a more efficient purchase, thanks to
flexible resources and grid reinforcement. On the other side an increase
of MB can be expected in line with the increasing volatility driven by
the strong development of RES in the scenario, sustaining units
operativity.

**ANCILLARY SERVICES EX-ANTE VOLUMES EVOLVE ACCORDING TO THE COMPOSITION

Procured ex-ante ancillary services volumes are expected to remain low
compared to the recent past also in the alternative scenarios, with some
differences determined by the different degree of competition in the
thermoelectric sector on the DAM -- that translates into different
levels of running reserve.
:::

#### 26-31 {.unnumbered}
:::

Rapid growth of non-programmable renewable generation in the Low
scenario is counterbalanced by grid developments and a faster
development of energy intensive storages. In the High scenario the
development of less flexible resources increases the need to purchase
more volumes on MSD.
:::
:::

::: callout-item
::: callout-left
#### 31-50 {.unnumbered}
:::

::: callout-right
In the Low scenario, further grid development and a major development of
energy intensive storage assets help containing ASM volumes. In the High
scenario instead ASM volumes remains stable, because of an increased
presence of CCGT on the DAM and the of still active coal plants untill
2025, furthermore development of energy intensive storage allows to beer
regulate the system.

**GRID BOTTLENECKS RESOLUTION AND BESS PENETRATION ARE AMONG THE MAIN
DRIVERS OF THE FUTURE ASM COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS. THE CAPACITY MARKET

During the first years of delivery of the Capacity Market, the strike
price is expected to have a cap effect on prices for start-up and upward
regulation, especially in the Centre-South market zone. However, the
recent downward trend of ASM volumes could foster price competition all
over Italy compared to past years.

Price competition on the ASM is expected to grow progressively as
innovative technological solutions will be gradually available in the
system at an increasingly competitive price (e.g., electrochemical
storages). Under the hypothesis of an extension of the capacity
remuneration mechanism, the strike price, together with the LCOS of
batteries, could become the main factors influencing ancillary services
prices in the future.

Price projections are based on a statiscal approach describing the
historical bidding strategies of market players on the ASM. Historical
distribuotins of price spreads between DAM and ASM prices for each type
of service are assumed constant in the future. Compared to the previous
release, the new ASM price projections incorporate the effects of
updated hypothesis determining DAM dynamics and prices.
